<p class="first">That &ldquo;east is east, and west is west, and never
the twain shall meet,&rdquo; is an axiom with most Englishmen to whom
the oriental character seems an insoluble enigma. This form of
agnosticism is unworthy of a nation which is responsible for the
happiness of 300,000,000 Asiatics. It is not justified by history,
which teaches us that civilisation is the result of the mutual action
of Europe and Asia; and that the advanced races of India are our own
kinsfolk.</p>
<p>The scene of Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s tales has been won from the sea by
alluvial action. Its soil, enriched by yearly deposits of silt, yields
abundantly without the aid of manure. A hothouse climate and regular
rainfall made Bengal the predestined breeding-ground of mankind; the
seat of an ancient and complex civilisation. But subsistence is too
easily secured in those fertile plains. Malaria, due to the absence of
subsoil drainage, is ubiquitous, and the standard of vitality extremely
low. Bengal has always been at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e212"

The earliest inroad was prompted by economic necessity. About 2000 B.C.
a congeries of races which are now styled &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; were
driven by the shrinkage of water from their pasture-grounds in Central
Asia. They penetrated Europe in successive hordes, who were ancestors
of our Celts, Hellenes, Slavs, Teutons and Scandinavians. Sanskrit was
the Aryans&rsquo; mother-tongue, and it forms the basis of nearly every
European language. A later swarm turned the western flank of the
Himalayas, and descended on Upper India. Their rigid discipline,
resulting from vigorous group-selection, gave the invaders an easy
victory over the negroid hunters and fishermen who peopled India. All
races of Aryan descent exhibit the same characteristics. They split
into endogamous castes, each of which pursues its own interests at the
expense of other castes. From the dawn of history we find kings, nobles
and priests riding roughshod over a mass of herdsmen, cultivators and
artisans. These ruling castes are imbued with pride of colour. The
Aryans&rsquo; fair complexions differentiated them from the coal-black
aborigines; <i>varna</i> in Sanskrit means &ldquo;caste&rdquo; and
&ldquo;colour&rdquo;. Their aesthetic instinct finds expression in a
passionate love of poetry, and a tangible object in the tribal chiefs.
Loyalty is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e217" href="#xd26e217"
name="xd26e217">ix</a>]</span>a religion which is almost proof against
its idol&rsquo;s selfishness and incompetence.</p>
<p>Caste is a symptom of arrested social development; and no community
which tolerates it is free from the scourge of civil strife. Class war
is the most salient fact in history. Warriors, termed Kshatriyas in
Sanskrit, were the earliest caste. Under the law of specialisation
defence fell to the lot of adventurous spirits, whose warlike prowess
gave them unlimited prestige with the peaceful masses. They became the
governing element, and were able to transmit their privileges by male
filiation. But they had to reckon with the priests, descended from
bards who attached themselves to the court of a Kshatriya prince and
laid him under the spell of poetry. Lust of dominion is a manifestation
of the Wish to Live; the priests used their tremendous power for
selfish ends. They imitated the warriors in forming a caste, which
claimed descent from Brahma, the Creator&rsquo;s head, while Kshatriyas
represented his arms, and the productive classes his less noble
members.</p>
<p>In the eleventh century B.C. the warrior clans rose in revolt
against priestly arrogance: and Hindustan witnessed a conflict between
the religious and secular arms. Brahminism had the terrors of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e223" href="#xd26e223" name=
"xd26e223">x</a>]</span>hell fire on its side; feminine influence was
its secret ally; the world is governed by brains, not muscles; and
spiritual authority can defy the mailed fist. After a prolonged
struggle the Kshatriyas were fain to acknowledge their inferiority.</p>
<p>When a hierocracy has been firmly established its evolution always
follows similar lines. Ritual becomes increasingly elaborate:
metaphysical dogma grows too subtle for a layman&rsquo;s comprehension.
Commercialism spreads from the market to the sanctuary, whose guardians
exploit the all-pervading fear of the unknown to serve their lust of
luxury and rule.</p>
<p>Brahminism has never sought to win proselytes; the annals of ancient
India record none of those atrocious persecutions which stained
mediaeval Christianity. It competed with rival creeds by offering
superior advantages: and the barbarous princes of India were kept under
the priestly heel by an appeal to their animal instincts. A fungoid
literature of abominations grew up in the Tantras, which are filthy
dialogues between Siva, the destroying influence in nature, and his
consorts. One of these, K&aacute;li by name, is the impersonation of
slaughter. Her shrine, near Calcutta, is knee-deep in blood, and the
<i>Dhy&aacute;n</i> or formula for contemplating her glories, is a
tissue of unspeakable obscenity. Most Hindus are Saktas, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e232" href="#xd26e232" name=
"xd26e232">xi</a>]</span>or worshippers of the female generative
principle: happily for civilisation they are morally in advance of
their creed. But it is a significant fact that K&aacute;li is the
tutelary goddess of extremist politicians, whose minds are prepared for
the acceptance of anarchism by the ever-present ideal of
destruction.</p>
<p>It was Bengal&rsquo;s misfortune that its people received Brahminism
in a corrupt and degenerate form. According to legend, King Adisur, who
reigned there in the ninth century of our era, imported five priests
from Kanauj to perform indispensable sacrifices. From this stock the
majority of Bengali Brahmins claim descent. The immigrants were
attended by five servants, who are the reputed ancestors of the Kayasth
caste. In Sanskrit this word means &ldquo;Standing on the Body,&rdquo;
whence Kayasths claim to be Kshatriyas. But the tradition of a servile
origin persisted, and they were forbidden to study the sacred writings.
An inherited bent for literature has stood them in good stead: they
became adepts in Persian, and English is almost their second
mother-tongue to-day. Kayasths figure largely in Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s
tales: their history proves that the pen is mightier than the
sword.</p>
<p>Economic necessity was the cause of the first invasion of India: the
second was inspired by religion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e238" href="#xd26e238" name="xd26e238">xii</a>]</span>The
evolution of organised creeds is not from simple to complex, but
<i>vice versa</i>. From the bed-rock of magic they rise through
nature-worship and man-worship to monotheism. The god of a conquering
tribe is imposed on subdued enemies, and becomes Lord of Heaven and
Earth. Monotheism of this type took root among the Hebrews, from whom
Mohammed borrowed the conception. His gospel was essentially militant
and proselytising. Nothing can resist a blend of the aesthetic and
combative instincts; within a century of the founder&rsquo;s death his
successors had conquered Central Asia, and gained a permanent footing
in Europe. In the tenth century a horde of Afghan Moslems penetrated
Upper India.</p>
<p>The Kshatriya princes fought with dauntless courage, but unity of
action was impossible; for the Brahmins fomented mutual jealousies and
checked the growth of national spirit. They were subdued piecemeal; and
in 1176 A.D. an Afghan Emperor governed Upper India from Delhi. The
Aryan element in Bengal had lost its martial qualities; and offered no
resistance to Afghan conquest, which was consummated in 1203. The
invaders imposed their religion by fire and sword. The Mohammadans of
Eastern Bengal, numbering 58 per cent., of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e245" href="#xd26e245" name=
"xd26e245">xiii</a>]</span>population, represent compulsory conversions
effected between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries. Eight
hundred years of close contact have abated religious hatred; and
occasional outbursts are due to priestly instigation. Hindus borrowed
the Zenana system from their conquerors, who imitated them in
discouraging widow-remarriages. Caste digs a gulf between followers of
the rival creeds, but Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s tales prove that a good
understanding is possible. It is now imperilled by the curse of
political agitation.</p>
<p>In 1526 the Afghan dynasty was subverted by a Mongol chieftain
lineally descended from Tamerlane. His grandson Akbar&rsquo;s reign
(1560&ndash;1605) was India&rsquo;s golden age. Akbar the Great was a
ruler of the best modern type, who gave his subjects all the essentials
of civilisation. But he knew that material prosperity is only the means
to an end. Man, said Ruskin, is an engine whose motive power is the
soul; and its fuel is love. Akbar called all the best elements in
society to his side and linked them in the bonds of sympathy.</p>
<p>Religion in its highest phase is coloured by mysticism which seeks
emblems of the hidden source of harmony in every form of life.
Anthropomorphic conceptions are laid aside; ritual is abandoned as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e252" href="#xd26e252" name=
"xd26e252">xiv</a>]</span>savouring of magic; hierocracy as part of an
obsolete caste system; metaphysical dogma because the Infinite cannot
be weighed in the balances of human reason. The truce to fanaticism
called by Akbar the Great encouraged a poet and reformer named Tulsi
D&aacute;sa (1532&ndash;1623) to point a surer way to salvation. He
adored Krishna, the preserving influence incarnate as R&aacute;ma, and
rehandled Valmiki&rsquo;s great epic, the R&aacute;m&aacute;yana, in
the faint rays of Christian light which penetrated India during that
age of transition. Buddha had proclaimed the brotherhood of man; Tulsi
D&aacute;sa deduced it from the fatherhood of God. The Preserver,
having sojourned among men, can understand their infirmities, and is
ever ready to save his sinful creatures who call upon him. The duty of
leading others to the fold is imposed on believers, for we are all
children of the same Father. Tulsi D&aacute;sa&rsquo;s
R&aacute;m&aacute;yana is better known in Bihar and the United
Provinces than is the Bible in rural England. The people of Hindustan
are not swayed by relentless fate, nor by the goddess of destruction.
Their prayers are addressed to a God who loves his meanest adorer; they
accept this world&rsquo;s buffetings with resignation: while
R&aacute;ma reigns all is well.</p>
<p>If the hereditary principle were sound, the Empire cemented together
by Akbar&rsquo;s statecraft might have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e256" href="#xd26e256" name="xd26e256">xv</a>]</span>defied
aggression. His successors were debauchees or fanatics. They neglected
the army; a recrudescence of the nomad instinct sent them wandering
over India with a locust-like horde of followers; Hindus were
persecuted, and their temples were destroyed. So the military castes
whose religion was threatened, rose in revolt; Viceroys threw off
allegiance, and carved out kingdoms for themselves. Within a century of
Akbar&rsquo;s death his Empire was a prey to anarchy.</p>
<p>India had hitherto enjoyed long spells of immunity from foreign
interference. Her people, defended by the Himalayan wall and the ocean,
were free to develop their own scheme of national life; and
world-forces which pierce the thickest crust of custom, reached them in
attenuated volume. Their isolation ended when the sea was no longer a
barrier; and for maritime nations it is but an extension of their
territory. A third invasion began in the sixteenth century, and has
continued till our own day. The underlying motive was not economic
necessity, nor religious enthusiasm, but sheer lust of gain.</p>
<p>In 1498 Vasco da Gama discovered an all-sea route to India, thus
opening the fabulous riches of Asia to hungry Europe. Portuguese,
Dutch, French and English adventurers embarked in a struggle for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e262" href="#xd26e262" name=
"xd26e262">xvi</a>]</span>Indian commerce, in which our ancestors were
victorious because they obtained the command of the sea, and had the
whole resources of the mother-country at their back.</p>
<p>Westerners are so imbued with the profit-making instinct that they
mentally open, a ledger account in order to prove that India gains more
than she loses by dependence on the people of these islands. It cannot
be denied that the fabric of English administration is a noble monument
of the civil skill and military prowess developed by our race. We have
given the peninsula railways and canals, postal and telegraph systems,
a code of laws which is far in advance of our own. Profound peace
broods over the empire, famine and pestilence are fought with the
weapons of science. It would be easy to pile up items on the debit side
of our imaginary cash-book. Free trade has destroyed indigenous crafts
wholesale, and quartered the castes who pursued them on an over-taxed
soil. Incalculable is the waste of human life and inherited skill
caused by the shifting of productive energy from India to Great
Britain, Germany and America. It cannot be said that the oversea
commerce, which amounted in 1907&ndash;8 to &pound;241,000,000, is an
unmixed benefit. The empire exports food and raw materials, robbing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e266" href="#xd26e266" name=
"xd26e266">xvii</a>]</span>the soil of priceless constituents, and buys
manufactured goods which ought to be produced at home. Foreign commerce
is stimulated by the home charges, which average &pound;18,000,000, and
it received an indirect bounty by the closure of the mints in 1893. The
textile industry of Lancashire was built upon a prohibition of Indian
muslins: it now exports yarn and piece goods to the tune of
&pound;32,000,000, and this trade was unjustly favoured at the expense
of local mills under the Customs Tariff of 1895. But there are forces
in play for good or evil which cannot be appraised in money. From a
material point of view our Government is the best and most honest in
existence. If it fails to satisfy the psychical cravings of India there
are shortcomings on both sides; and some of them are revealed by Mr.
Banerjea&rsquo;s tales.</p>
<p><i>Caste</i>.&mdash;As a <i>Kulin</i>, or pedigreed Brahmin, he is
naturally prone to magnify the prestige of his order. It has been
sapped by incidents of foreign rule and the spread of mysticism.
Pandits find their stupendous lore of less account than the literary
baggage of a university graduate. Brahmin pride is outraged by the
advancement of men belonging to inferior castes. The priesthood&rsquo;s
dream is to regain the ascendancy usurped by a race of <i>Mlecchas</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e278" href="#xd26e278" name=
"xd26e278">xviii</a>]</span>(barbarians); and it keeps orthodox Hindus
in a state of suppressed revolt. One centre of the insidious agitation
is the fell goddess K&aacute;li&rsquo;s shrine near Calcutta; another
is Puna, which has for centuries been a stronghold of the clannish
M&aacute;r&aacute;th&aacute; Brahmans. Railways have given a mighty
impetus to religion by facilitating access to places of pilgrimage; the
post office keeps disaffected elements in touch; and English has become
a <i>lingua franca</i>.</p>
<p>While Brahminism, if it dared, could proclaim a religious war, it
has powerful enemies within the hierarchy. A desire for social
recognition is universal. It was the Patricians&rsquo; refusal to
intermarry with Plebeians that caused the great constitutional
struggles of Ancient Rome. Many of the lowest castes are rebelling
against Brahmin arrogance. They have waxed rich by growing lucrative
staples, and a strong minority are highly educated. Mystical sects have
already thrown off the priestly yoke. But caste is by no means confined
to races of Indian blood. What is the snobbery which degrades our
English character but the Indo-German Sudra&rsquo;s reverence for his
Brahmin? The Europeans constitute a caste which possesses some
solidarity against &ldquo;natives,&rdquo; and they have spontaneously
adopted these anti-social distinctions. At the apex stand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e288" href="#xd26e288" name=
"xd26e288">xix</a>]</span>covenanted civilians; whose service is now
practically a close preserve for white men. It is split into the
Secretariat, who enjoy a superb climate <i>plus</i> Indian pay and
furlough, and the &ldquo;rank and file&rdquo; doomed to swelter in the
plains. <i>Esprit de corps</i>, which is the life-blood of caste, has
vanished. Officers of the Educational Service, recruited from the same
social strata, rank as &ldquo;uncovenanted&rdquo;; and a sense of
humiliation reacts on their teaching.</p>
<p><i>The Land</i>.&mdash;In 1765 Clive secured for the East India
Company the right of levying land-tax in Bengal. It was then collected
by zemindars, a few of whom were semi-independent nobles, and the rest
mere farmers of revenue, who bid against one another at the periodical
settlements. Tenant right apart, the conception of private property in
the soil was inconceivable to the Indian mind. Every one knows that it
was borrowed by English lawyers from the Roman codes, when
commercialism destroyed the old feudal nexus. Lord Cornwallis&rsquo;s
permanent Settlement of 1793 was a revolution as drastic in its degree
as that which Prance was undergoing. Zemindars were presented with the
land for which they had been mere rakers-in of revenue. It was
parcelled out into &ldquo;estates,&rdquo; which might be bought and
sold like moveable property. A tax levied at customary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e300" href="#xd26e300" name=
"xd26e300">xx</a>]</span>rates became &ldquo;rent&rdquo; arrived at by
a process of bargaining between the landlord and ignorant rustics. The
Government demand was fixed for ever, but no attempt was made to
safeguard the ryot&rsquo;s interests. Cornwallis and his henchmen
fondly supposed that they were manufacturing magnates of the English
type, who had made our agriculture a model for the world. They were
grievously mistaken. Under the cast-iron law of sale most of the
original zemindars lost their estates, which passed into the hands of
parvenus saturated with commercialism. Bengal is not indebted to its
zemindars for any of the new staples which have created so vast a
volume of wealth. They are content to be annuitants on the land, and
sub-infeudation has gone to incredible lengths. Most of them are
absentees whose one thought is to secure a maximum of unearned
increment from tillers of the soil. In 1765 the land revenue amounted
to &pound;3,400,000, of which &pound;258,000 was allotted to zemindars.
A century afterwards their net profits were estimated at
&pound;12,000,000, and they are now probably half as much again. The
horrible oppression described by Mr. Banerjea is impossible in our era
of law-courts, railways and newspapers. But it is always dangerous to
bring the sense of brotherhood, on which civilisation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e302" href="#xd26e302" name=
"xd26e302">xxi</a>]</span>depends, into conflict with crude animal
instincts. In days of American slavery the planter&rsquo;s interest
prompted him to treat his human cattle with consideration, yet Simon
Legrees were not unknown. It is a fact that certain zemindars are in
the habit of remeasuring their ryots&rsquo; holdings periodically, and
always finding more land than was set forth in the lease.</p>
<p><i>The Police</i>.&mdash;A pale copy of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s
famous system was introduced in 1861, when hosts of inspectors,
sub-inspectors and head constables were let loose on Bengal. The new
force was highly unpopular, and failed to attract the educated classes.
Subaltern officers, therefore, used power for private ends, while the
masses were so inured to oppression that they offered no resistance.
There has been a marked improvement in the <i>personnel</i> of late
years; and Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s lurid pictures of corruption and petty
tyranny apply to a past generation of policemen. The
Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Bengal does justice to a much-abused
service in his Administrative Report for 1907&ndash;8. His Honour
&ldquo;believes the force to be a hard-working body of Government
servants, the difficulties, trials, and even dangers of whose duties it
is impossible for the public at large really to appreciate&rdquo;. He
acknowledges that &ldquo;India <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e311"
href="#xd26e311" name="xd26e311">xxii</a>]</span>is passing through a
period of transition. Old pre-possessions and unscientific methods must
be cast aside, and the value of the confession must be held at a
discount.&rdquo; Bengal policemen fail as egregiously as their British
colleagues in coping with professional crime. Burglary is a positive
scourge, and the habit of organising gang-robberies has spread to
youths of the middle class.</p>
<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;Though Mr. Banerjea has no experience of the
inner working of our Government offices, he speaks on education with an
expert&rsquo;s authority. Lord Macaulay, who went to India in 1834 as
legal member of Council, was responsible for the introduction of
English as the vehicle of instruction. He had gained admission to the
caste of Whigs, whose battle-cry was &ldquo;Knowledge for the
People,&rdquo; and his brilliant rhetoric overpowered the arguments of
champions of oriental learning. Every one with a smattering of
Sanskrit, Arabic or Persian, regrets the fact that those glorious
languages have not been adequately cultivated in modern India. Bengali
is a true daughter of the Sanskrit; it has Italian sweetness and German
capacity for expressing abstract ideas. No degree of proficiency in an
alien tongue can compensate for the neglect of the vernacular.
Moreover, the curriculum introduced in the &ldquo;thirties&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e317" href="#xd26e317" name=
"xd26e317">xxiii</a>]</span>was purely academic. It came to India
directly from English universities, which had stuck fast in the ruts of
the Renaissance. Undue weight was given to literary training, while
science and technical skill were despised. Our colleges and schools do
not attempt to build character on a foundation of useful habits and
tastes that sweeten life; to ennoble ideals, or inspire self-knowledge,
self-reliance, and self-control. Technical education is still in its
infancy; and the aesthetic instinct which lies dormant in every
Aryan&rsquo;s brain is unawakened. A race which invented the loom now
invents nothing but grievances. In 1901 Bengal possessed 69,000 schools
and colleges, attended by 1,700,000 pupils, yet only one adult male in
10 and one female in 144 can read and write! The Calcutta University is
an examining body on the London model. It does not attempt to enforce
discipline in a city which flaunts every vice known to great seaports
and commercial centres, unmitigated by the social instinct. Nor is the
training of covenanted civilians more satisfactory. In 1909 only 1 out
of 50 selected candidates presented himself for examination in Sanskrit
or Arabic! Men go out to India at twenty-four, knowing little of the
ethnology, languages or history, of the races they are about to govern.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e319" href="#xd26e319" name=
"xd26e319">xxiv</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Agriculture</i>.&mdash;Seventy-two per cent. of <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e324" title="Not in source">the</span> Bengalis live by
cultivating the soil. The vast majority are in the clutches of some
local Shylock, who sweeps their produce into his garners, doling out
inadequate supplies of food and seed grain. Our courts of law are used
by these harpies as engines of oppression; toil as he may the ryot is
never free from debt. The current rates of interest leave no profit
from agriculture or trade. Twelve to 18 per cent. is charged for loans
on ample landed security; and ordinary cultivators are mulcted in 40 to
60. A haunting fear of civil discord, and purblind conservatism in the
commercial castes, are responsible for the dearth of capital. India
imports bullion amounting to &pound;25,000,000 a year, to the great
detriment of European credit, and nine-tenths of it is hoarded in the
shape of ornaments or invested in land, which is a badge of social
rank. Yet the Aryan nature is peculiarly adapted to co-operation. If
facilities for borrowing at remunerative rates existed in towns,
agricultural banks on the Schulze-Delitzsch and Raiffeisen systems
would soon overspread the land. Credit and co-operative groupings for
the purchase of seed, fertilisers and implements, are the twin pillars
of rural industry. Indian ryots are quite as receptive of new ideas as
English farmers. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e327" href=
"#xd26e327" name="xd26e327">xxv</a>]</span>bought many thousands of
little iron sugar mills, placed on the market a generation back by some
English speculators, and will adopt any improvements of practical value
if the price is brought within their slender means.</p>
<p>The revolution which began a decade ago in America has not spread to
Bengal, where the average yield of grain per acre is only 10 bushels as
compared with 30 in Europe. Yet it has been calculated that another
bushel would defray the whole cost of Government! Bengalis obey the
injunction &ldquo;increase and multiply&rdquo; without regard for
consequences. Their habitat has a population of 552 per square mile,
and in some districts the ratio exceeds 900. Clearly there is a
pressing need of scientific agriculture, to replace or supplement the
rule-of-thumb methods in which the ryot is a past master.</p>
<p><i>The Bengali Character</i>.&mdash;Mr. Banerjea has lifted a corner
of the veil that guards the Indian&rsquo;s home from prying eyes. He
shows that Bengalis are men of like passions with us. The picture is
perhaps overcharged with shade. Sycophants, hustlers and cheats abound
in every community; happily for the future of civilisation there is
also a leaven of true nobility: &ldquo;The flesh striveth against the
spirit,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e336" href="#xd26e336"
name="xd26e336">xxvi</a>]</span>nor does it always gain mastery. Having
mixed with all classes for twenty eventful years, and speaking the
vernacular fluently, I am perhaps entitled to hold an opinion on this
much-vexed question. The most salient feature in the Indian nature is
its boundless charity. There are no poor laws, and the struggle for
life is very severe; yet the aged and infirm, the widow and the orphan
have their allotted share in the earnings of every household. It is a
symptom of approaching famine that beggars are perforce refused their
daily dole. Cruelty to children is quite unknown. Parents will deny
themselves food in order to defray a son&rsquo;s schooling-fees or
marry a daughter with suitable provision. Bengalis are remarkably
clannish: they will toil and plot to advance the interests of anyone
remotely connected with them by ties of blood.</p>
<p>Their faults are the outcome of superstition, slavery to custom, and
an unhealthy climate. Among them is a lack of moral courage, a tendency
to lean on stronger natures, and to flatter a superior by feigning to
agree with him. The standard of truth and honesty is that of all races
which have been ground under heel for ages: deceit is the weapon of
weaklings and slaves. Perjury has become a fine art, because our legal
system fosters the chicane which is innate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e340" href="#xd26e340" name=
"xd26e340">xxvii</a>]</span>in quick-witted peoples. The same man who
lies unblushingly in an English court, will tell the truth to an
assembly of caste-fellows, or to the <i>Panohayat</i> (a committee of
five which arbitrates in private disputes). Let British Pharisees study
the working of their own Divorce and County Courts: they will not find
much evidence of superior virtue! As for honesty, the essence of
commercialism is &ldquo;taking advantage of other people&rsquo;s
needs,&rdquo; and no legal code has yet succeeded in drawing a line
between fair and unfair trade. In India and Japan merchants are an
inferior class; and loss of self-respect reacts unfavourably on the
moral sense. Ingratitude is a vice attributed to Bengalis by people who
have done little or nothing to elicit the corresponding virtue. As a
matter of fact their memory is extremely retentive of favours. They
will overlook any shortcomings in a ruler who has the divine gift of
sympathy, and serve him with devotion. Macaulay has branded them with
cowardice. If the charge were true, it was surely illogical and unmanly
to reproach a community numbering 50,000,000 for inherited defects.
Difference of environment and social customs will account for the
superior virility of Europeans as compared with their distant kinsmen
whose lot is cast in the sweltering tropics. But no one who has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e345" href="#xd26e345" name=
"xd26e345">xxviii</a>]</span>observed Bengali schoolboys standing up
bare-legged to fast bowling will question their bravery. In fact, the
instinct of combativeness is universal, and among protected communities
it finds vent in litigation.</p>
<p>Englishmen who seek to do their duty by India have potential allies
in the educated classes, who have grafted Western learning on a
civilisation much more ancient than their own. Bengal has given many
illustrious sons to the empire. Among the dead I may mention Pandits
Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Kissari Mohan Ganguli, whose vast
learning was eclipsed by their zeal for social service; Dr. Sambhu
Chandra Mukharji, whose biography I wrote in 1895; and Mr. Umesh
Chandra Banarji, a lawyer who held his own with the flower of our
English bar. A Bengali Brahmin is still with us who directs one of the
greatest contracting firms in the empire. How much brighter would
India&rsquo;s outlook be if this highly-gifted race were linked in
bonds of sympathy with our own!</p>
<p>The women of the Gangetic delta deserve a better fate than is
assigned to them by Hindu and Mohammadan custom. They are kept in
leading-strings from the cradle to the grave; their intellect is rarely
cultivated, their affections suffer atrophy from constant repression.
Yet Mr. Banerjea draws more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e351"
href="#xd26e351" name="xd26e351">xxix</a>]</span>than one picture of
wifely devotion, and the instinctive good sense which is one of the
secrets of feminine influence. Women seldom fail to rise to the
occasion when opportunity is vouchsafed them. The late Maharani
Surnomoyi of Cossimbazar managed her enormous estates with acumen; and
her charities were as lavish as Lady Burdett-Coutts&rsquo;s. Toru Dutt,
who died in girlhood, wrote French and English verses full of haunting
sweetness. It is a little premature for extremists to prate of autonomy
while their women are prisoners or drudges.</p>
<p><i>Superstition</i>.&mdash;Modes of thought surviving from past ages
of intellectual growth are the chief obstacles in the path of progress.
Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s tales contain many references to magic&mdash;a
pseudo-science which clings to the world&rsquo;s religions and social
polity. It is doubtful whether the most civilised of us has quite
shaken off the notion that mysterious virtues may be transmitted
without the impetus of will-power. Latin races are haunted by dread of
the Evil Eye; advertisements of palmists, astrologers and
crystal-gazers fill columns of our newspapers. Rational education alone
enables us to trace the sequence of cause and effect which is visible
in every form of energy. Until this truth is generally recognised no
community can eradicate the vices of superstition. <span class=

<p>The &ldquo;unrest&rdquo; of which we hear so much finds no echo in
Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s pages. It is, indeed, confined to a minute
percentage of the population, even including the callow schoolboys who
have been tempted to waste precious years on politics. The masses are
too ignorant and too absorbed by the struggle for existence to care one
jot for reforms. They may, however, be stirred to blind fury by
appealing to their prejudices. Therein lies a real danger. Divergence
of religious ideals, to which I have already alluded, accounts for the
tranquillity that prevails throughout Bihar as compared with the spirit
of revolution in Bengal proper. The microbe of anarchy finds an
excellent culture-ground in minds which grovel before the goddess
K&aacute;li. But the unrest cannot be isolated from other
manifestations of cosmic energy, which flash from mind to mind and keep
the world in turmoil. Every force of nature tends to be periodic. The
heart&rsquo;s systole and diastole; alternations of day and night, of
season and tide, are reflected in the history of our race. Progress is
secured by the swing of a giant pendulum from East to West, the end of
each beat ushering in drastic changes in religion, economics and social
polity. It is probable that one of these cataclysmic epochs opened with
the victories wrested from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e360"
href="#xd26e360" name="xd26e360">31</a>]</span>Russia by Japan. The
democratic upheaval which began five hundred years ago is assuming
Protean forces; and amongst them is the malady aptly styled
&ldquo;constitutionalitis&rdquo; by Dr. Dillon. The situation in India
demands prescience and statecraft. Though world-forces cannot be
withstood, they are susceptible of control by enlightened will-power.
Will peace be restored by the gift of constitutional government at a
crisis when the august Mother of Parliaments is herself a prey to
faction? It is worthy of note that the self-same spirit has always been
rife in Bengal, where every village has its <i>Dals</i>&mdash;local
Montagues and Capulets, whose bickerings are a fertile source of
litigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Banerjea&rsquo;s tales were written for his own countrymen, and
needed extensive revision in order to render them intelligible to
Western readers. I have preserved the author&rsquo;s spirit and
phraseology; and venture to hope that this little book will shed some
light on the problem of Indian administration.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Pride of Kadampur.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Kadampur is a country village which is destitute of
natural or artificial attractions and quite unknown to fame. Its census
population is barely 1,500, four-fifths of whom are low-caste Hindus,
engaged in cultivation and river-fishing; the rest Mohammadans, who
follow the same avocations but dwell in a <i>P&aacute;r&aacute;</i>
(quarter) of their own. The <i>Bhadralok</i>, or Upper Crust, consists
of two Brahman and ten Kayastha (writer-caste) families. Among the
latter group Kumodini Kanta Basu&rsquo;s took an unquestioned lead. He
had amassed a modest competence as sub-contractor in the Commissariat
during the second Afghan War, and retired to enjoy it in his ancestral
village. His first care was to rebuild the family residence, a
congenial task which occupied five years and made a large hole in his
savings. It slowly grew into a masonry structure divided into two
distinct <i>Mah&aacute;ls</i> (wings)&mdash;the first inhabited by
men-folk; the second sacred to the ladies and their attendants. Behind
it stood the kitchen; and the <i>Pujard&aacute;l&aacute;n</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e390" href="#xd26e390" name=
"xd26e390">2</a>]</span>(family temple) occupied a conspicuous place in
front, facing south. The usual range of brick cattle-sheds and
servants&rsquo; quarters made up quite an imposing group of
buildings.</p>
<p>Villagers classed amongst the gentry are wont to gather daily at
some <i>Chandimandap</i> (a rustic temple dedicated to the goddess
Durga, attached to most better-class houses). Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s was
a favourite rendezvous, and much time was killed there in conversation,
card-playing, and chess. Among the group assembled, one crisp afternoon
in February, was an old gentleman, called Sh&aacute;msundar Ghosh, and
known to hosts of friends as &ldquo;Sh&aacute;m Babu&rdquo;. He was
head clerk in a Calcutta merchant&rsquo;s office, drawing Rs. 60 a
month (&pound;48 a year at par), which sufficed for the support of his
wife and a son and daughter, respectively named Susil and Shaibalini.
After a vain attempt to make two ends meet in expensive Calcutta, he
had settled down at the outskirts of Kadampur, which has a railway
station within half an hour&rsquo;s run of the Metropolis. Sh&aacute;m
Babu&rsquo;s position and character were generally respected by
neighbours, who flocked to his house for Calcutta gossip.</p>
<p>On this particular occasion talk ran on Kadampur requirements, and
somebody opined that another tank for bathing and drinking purposes
ought to be excavated at once; he did not say by whom. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e399" href="#xd26e399" name=
"xd26e399">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; observed Sham Babu, &ldquo;but a market is still
more necessary. We have to trudge four miles for our vegetables and
fish, which are obtainable in a more or less stale condition only twice
a week. If one were started here, it would be a great boon to ten
villages at least.&rdquo; Kumodini Babu assented, without further
remark, and the subject dropped.</p>
<p>It came up again on the following Sunday, when Kumodini Babu said to
his friend:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about your idea of a market in this
village, and should like, if possible, to establish one myself. How
much would it cost me? As an old commissariat contractor, I am well up
in the price of grain, fodder and <i>ghi</i> (clarified butter used in
cooking), but I really know very little about other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confession elicited a general laugh, and Sh&aacute;m Babu
replied, &ldquo;It will be a matter of Rs. 200&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred rupees! Surely that is far too much for a range
of huts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough. Your own bamboo clumps, straw-stacks and stores
of cordage would provide raw material; and as for labour, all you have
to do is to order some of your ryots (tenants) who are behindhand with
their rent to work for you gratis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be contrary to my principles. How are these poor
people to live while engaged in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e417"
href="#xd26e417" name="xd26e417">4</a>]</span><i>beg&aacute;r</i>
(forced labour) on my behalf? They must be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, let us set apart Rs. 20 to meet the cost of
market buildings. But, for the first few weeks, you will have to buy up
the unsold stock of perishable goods brought by <i>Farias</i>
(hucksters); you must patronise the shopkeepers who open stalls for
selling grain, cloth, confectionery, tobacco and trinkets. Once these
people find that they are making fair profits they will gladly pay you
rent for space allotted, besides tolls on the usual scale. At least Rs.
180 must be set apart for these preliminary expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kumodini Babu never did anything in haste. A fortnight elapsed ere
he announced to the neighbours gathered in his <i>Chandimandap</i> that
he intended starting a bi-weekly market on a vacant plot measuring one
<i>Bigha</i> (one-third of an acre), known as the
Kam&aacute;rb&aacute;ri (Anglice, &ldquo;Abode of Blacksmiths&rdquo;).
On an auspicious day towards the end of April, he inaugurated the new
enterprise with some ceremony. His own ryots were enjoined to attend;
shopkeepers, hucksters, and fishermen who had hitherto gone much
further afield, came in considerable numbers; and business was
amazingly brisk. Zemindars (landed proprietors) generally have to wait
for months and spend money like water before they gain a pice (a bronze
coin worth a farthing) from a new <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e435" href="#xd26e435" name="xd26e435">5</a>]</span>market.
Kumodini Babu, however, began to reap where he had sown in less than a
fortnight. Not an inch of space in the Karm&aacute;rb&aacute;ri
remained unoccupied; his H&aacute;t-Gomastha, or bailiff, levied rent
and tolls for vendors, at whose request the market was proclaimed a
tri-weekly one. His fame as a man of energy and public spirit spread
over ten villages, whose people felt that he was one who would give
them good counsel in times of difficulty.</p>
<p>There is some truth in the notion that fortune&rsquo;s gifts seldom
come singly. Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s success in a business venture was
immediately followed by one in his domestic affairs. It fell out in
this wise. Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s daughter, Shaibalini, was still
unmarried, though nearly thirteen and beautiful enough to be the pride
of Kadampur. Money was, indeed, the only qualification she lacked, and
Sham Babu&rsquo;s comparative poverty kept eligible suitors at a
distance. For three years he had sought far and wide for a son-in-law
and was beginning to fear that he might, after all, be unable to fulfil
the chief duty of a Hindu parent. One evening his wife unexpectedly
entered the parlour where he was resting after a heavy day at
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why has the moon risen so early?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the moon can&rsquo;t do otherwise,&rdquo; she
answered, with a faint smile. &ldquo;But, joking apart, I want
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e443" href="#xd26e443" name=
"xd26e443">36</a>]</span>to consult you about Saili. Our neighbour
Kanto Babu&rsquo;s wife called on me just before you returned from
Calcutta, and, after beating about the bush, suggested Kumodini
Babu&rsquo;s younger son, Nalini, as a suitable match for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s face wore a worried look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that would be flying too high for such as us,&rdquo;
he rejoined. &ldquo;The Basus are comparatively rich, and very proud of
their family which settled here during the Mughal days (<i>i.e.</i>,
before British rule, which in Bengal date from 1765). Young Nalini is
reading for his B.A. examination and wants to be a pleader (advocate).
Kumodini Babu would hardly allow his son to marry the daughter of a
poor clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, there is no harm in trying,&rdquo; remarked the wife.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel equal to approaching him, there&rsquo;s
Kanto Babu who would do so. It was his wife who broached the subject to
me, which makes me think that they have been discussing it
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea,&rdquo; exclaimed Sh&aacute;m Babu.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him at once.&rdquo; And taking his stick, he
set out for Kanto Babu&rsquo;s house, which was barely fifty yards off.
In half an hour he returned to gladden his wife with the news that
their neighbour had consented to act as a go-between.</p>
<p>Kanto Babu was as good as his word. That very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e458" href="#xd26e458" name=
"xd26e458">7</a>]</span>evening he called on Kumodini Babu, whom he
found reading the <i>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata</i> (an epic poem).
After dwelling now on this matter, now on that, he asked
casually:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you never thought of getting Nalini married? He is over
twenty, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife has been urging me to look out for a wife for him,
but in my opinion he is too young for such responsibilities. Better
wait till he has passed the B.A. examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s idea is sounder than yours, if I may be
permitted to say so. Just think of the awful temptations to which
unmarried students are exposed in that sink of profligacy, Calcutta!
How many promising lads have succumbed to them, wrecking their own
lives and causing bitter grief to their parents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kumodini Babu started. &ldquo;You surprise me! I had no idea that
Calcutta was as bad as you paint it. We must certainly get Nalini
married at once. I wonder whether you know of a likely match for him. I
don&rsquo;t care about money, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do,&rdquo; interrupted Kanto Babu,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s daughter, Shaibalini.
What a pretty creature she is; modest, loving and kind-hearted! You
won&rsquo;t find her equal in this <i>el&aacute;qa</i> (lit.
jurisdiction). If you approve, I will gladly be your spokesman with her
family.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e477" href="#xd26e477"
name="xd26e477">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kumodini Babu mused awhile before answering. &ldquo;I know
Shaibalini well by reputation, and she is all you describe her.
Sh&aacute;m Babu, too, comes of excellent lineage, though he is not a
Zemindar, and depends on service. I should not object to marrying
Nalini with his daughter. But wait a bit: what <i>gotra</i> (clan) does
he belong to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he is a Dakhin R&aacute;rhi,&rdquo; answered Kanto
Babu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am an Uttar R&aacute;rhi,&rdquo; remarked Kumodini
Babu. &ldquo;Is not that a fatal objection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the benefit of non-Hindu readers I may explain that Kayasthas
are split into clans&mdash;probably a survival of the tribal
organisation which preceded the family almost everywhere. According to
tradition, a King of Bengal named &Aacute;disur imported five Brahmans,
and as many Kayastha servants from Kanauj in Upper India. From the
latter are descended the Ghosh, Basu, Mitra, Guha, and Datta families.
The first four are generally recognised as K&uacute;lin (Angl.,
&ldquo;aristocratic&rdquo;) Kayasthas, while the Dattas and seven other
families are known as Sindhu Maulik&mdash;&ldquo;coming of a good
stock&rdquo;. &Aacute;disur and his companions found 700 Brahmans and
the same number of Kayasthas already established in Bengal. These are
the supposed ancestors of a large number of Kayastha families still
termed Saptasati, &ldquo;the Seven <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e489" href="#xd26e489" name=
"xd26e489">9</a>]</span>Hundred&rdquo;. The ancient Greeks reckoned
their neighbours beyond the Hellenic pale as &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo;.
So Brahmans and Kayasthas of Central Bengal styled their congeners
north of the Ganges <i>R&aacute;rh</i>, or &ldquo;uncivilised&rdquo;.
The epithet survives in Uttar (north) and Dakhin (south) R&aacute;rhi,
but has lost its offensive meaning. B&aacute;rendra is another phrase
for the inhabitants of a tract north of the Ganges, which answers to
the modern districts of Rajshahi, Pabna, and Bogra.</p>
<p>Kanto Babu was evidently perplexed; but after reflecting for a short
time he asked, &ldquo;Now why should such a trifling matter cause any
trouble whatever? The time has long since passed away when arbitrary
difference of clan was considered a bar to marriage among
Kayasthas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; was Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s reply,
&ldquo;and personally I am above these old-fashioned prejudices. My
daughter-in-law may be Dakhin R&aacute;rhi, Banga-ja, or
B&aacute;rendri for all I care, provided she be comely, well-mannered
and come of good stock. But will Sh&aacute;m Babu be equally
tolerant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say until I have consulted him,&rdquo;
answered Kanto Babu. &ldquo;One thing more I must know. What is your
idea of <i>Den&aacute; P&aacute;ona</i> (a word answering to our
&lsquo;settlements&rsquo;)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;R&aacute;m, R&aacute;m!&rdquo; exclaimed Kumodini Babu.
&ldquo;Am <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e506" href="#xd26e506"
name="xd26e506">10</a>]</span>I the man to sell my son for filthy
lucre? I hear that Calcutta folks occasionally do so, but I am quite
opposed to the custom. Should Sh&aacute;m Babu agree to this match, I
will make no stipulations whatever as to a money payment. He is in very
moderate circumstances, and may give whatever he chooses. Please see
him at once and let me have his decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kanto Babu promised to do so and withdrew, inwardly chuckling over
his diplomacy.</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu called on him the same evening to learn its issue.
He was delighted to find that Kumodini Babu was not averse to the
match, but his face fell on hearing of the difference of clan.
Observing his agitation, Kanto Babu observed gently, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see why a matter, which is not even mentioned in our
Sh&aacute;stras (holy books), should cause one moment&rsquo;s
hesitation. Pluck up your courage, man, and all will go
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; murmured Sh&aacute;m Babu. &ldquo;But I do
stand in awe of the Sam&aacute;j&rdquo; (a caste-assembly which
pronounces excommunication for breaches of custom).</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all nonsense! Look at our friend Kunjal&aacute;l
Babu who has just married his son to a B&aacute;rendri girl. Is he an
outcast? Certainly not. It is true that the ultra-orthodox kicked a bit
at first; but they all came round, and joined in the ceremony with
zest. I can quote scores of similar instances to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e516" href="#xd26e516" name=
"xd26e516">11</a>]</span>prove that this prejudice against marrying
into a different clan is quite out of date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu had nothing to urge in opposition to these weighty
arguments. He promised to let Kanto Babu have a definite reply on the
morrow and kept his word. Having endured a curtain lecture from his
wife, who proved to him that an alliance with the Basu family offered
advantages far outweighing the slight risk there was of
excommunication, he authorised Kanto Babu to assure Kumodini Babu that
the proposed match had his hearty approval. Once preliminaries were
satisfactorily settled, all other arrangements proceeded apace. The
P&aacute;k&aacute; Dekh&aacute; is a solemn visit paid by males of the
future bridegroom&rsquo;s family to that of his betrothed, during which
they are feasted and decide all details regarding the marriage
ceremonies. It passed off without a hitch, and the <i>purohit</i>
(family priest) fixed Srav&aacute;n 17th as an auspicious day for
consummating the union. Thenceforward preparations were made for
celebrating it in a manner worthy of the esteem in which both families
were held.</p>
<p>Kumodini Babu issued invitations to all his relatives. Chief amongst
these was a younger brother, Ghaneshy&aacute;m Basu by name, who
practised as a pleader (advocate) at Ghoria, where he had built a house
after disposing of his interest in the family <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e525" href="#xd26e525" name=
"xd26e525">12</a>]</span>estate to Kumodini Babu. This important person
was asked to supervise the ceremonies, inasmuch as Kumodini
Babu&rsquo;s increasing age and infirmities rendered him unfit to do so
efficiently, while his eldest son, yclept Jadu Babu, had barely reached
man&rsquo;s estate. The letter of invitation referred incidentally to
the difference of clan as a matter of no importance. Kumodini
Babu&rsquo;s disappointment may be conceived when he got an answer from
his younger brother, expressing strong disapproval of the match and
ending with a threat to sever all connection with the family if it were
persisted in! The recipient at first thought of running up to Ghoria,
in view of softening Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s heart by a personal
appeal, but the anger caused by his want of brotherly feeling
prevailed. Kumodini Babu and his wife agreed that matters had gone too
far to admit of the marriage being broken off. If Ghaneshy&aacute;m did
not choose to take part in it, so much the worse for him!</p>
<p>Soon after dusk on Srav&aacute;n 17th, Nalini entered his palanquin,
arrayed in a beautiful costume of Benares silk. The wedding procession
set out forthwith, amid a mighty blowing of conch-shells and beating of
drums. At 8 P.M. it reached the bride&rsquo;s abode, where her family,
with Sh&aacute;m Babu at the head, were ready to receive them. An hour
later Nalini was conducted to the inner apartments, where the marriage
ceremony <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e529" href="#xd26e529" name=
"xd26e529">13</a>]</span>began. It lasted until nearly eleven
o&rsquo;clock, when the young couple were taken to the
B&aacute;s&aacute;rghar, or nuptial apartment. During these rites the
men-folk were perhaps more pleasantly engaged in doing ample justice to
a repast provided for them in the outer rooms. Then they chewed betels
in blissful rumination, before separating with emphatic acknowledgments
of the hospitality they had enjoyed.</p>
<p>On the following afternoon both bridegroom and bride were taken in
palanquins to Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s house, where she instantaneously
won every heart by her grace and beauty. Two days later the
Bau-Bh&aacute;t ceremony was held. This is a feast in the course of
which the bride (<i>bau</i>) distributes cooked rice
(<i>bh&aacute;t</i>) with her own hands to bidden guests, in token of
her reception into her husband&rsquo;s family and clan. Kumodini Babu
had requisitioned an immense supply of dainties from local
<i>go&aacute;las</i> (dairymen) and <i>moiras</i> (confectioners) with
a view to eclipsing all previous festivals of the kind.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the Bau-Bh&aacute;t day a palanquin was
carried into Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s courtyard; and who should emerge
from it but Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu! He ran up to his brother, who was
sitting with some neighbours in the parlour, and, clasping his feet,
implored forgiveness. Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s heart leaped for joy.
Tenderly did he embrace the penitent, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e547" href="#xd26e547" name="xd26e547">14</a>]</span>who admitted
that his peace of mind had fled from the moment he penned that cruel
letter. He now saw the absurdity of his prejudices, and begged Kumodini
Babu to forget his unbrotherly conduct. It is needless to add that the
prayer was cordially granted and that Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu received a
blessing from his elder brother. Thanks to his supervision the
Bau-Bh&aacute;t feast passed off at night without the slightest
contretemps. Ten years later people still dwelt on the magnificent
hospitality they had received, and held Kumodini Babu up as a model to
fathers-in-law. In order that all classes might rejoice with him, he
remitted a year&rsquo;s rent to every ryot, besides lavishing
considerable sums on Brahmans and poor folk. The more enlightened
section of Kayasthas were unanimous in pronouncing him to be a true
Hindu, on whose descendants the gods on high would pour down their
choicest blessings. There were others, however, whose malignity found
material to work on in his disregard of caste prejudices. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Rival Markets.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The immediate success of Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s market
caused infinite annoyance to Ramani Babu, who owned one long
established in the neighbourhood. Hucksters and country-folk found the
tolls levied there so much lighter, that the attendance at
Ramani&rsquo;s fell off grievously. It is well known that when a new
market is started, proprietors already in the field endeavour to break
it up with the aid of paid <i>l&aacute;thi&aacute;ls</i> (clubmen). If,
as often happens, the daring speculator be a man of substance, he
employs similar means in his defence. Free fights occur on market-days,
ending in many a broken head&mdash;sometimes in slaughter. The battle
is directed by Gomasthas (bailiffs) on either side, with the full
knowledge of their masters, who keep discreetly aloof from the
fray.</p>
<p>Ramani Babu did not foresee that his property would be injured by
the new venture, and allowed it to be firmly established without
striking a single blow. Finding a lamentable decrease in his receipts,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e560" href="#xd26e560" name=
"xd26e560">16</a>]</span>he ordered the bailiff to &ldquo;go
ahead,&rdquo; and took an early train for Calcutta in order to set up
an alibi in case of legal proceedings. A day or two later his bailiff,
attended by six or seven men armed with iron-shod bamboo staves,
assembled at the outskirts of Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s market, on a spot
where four roads met.</p>
<p>Ere long a cart was descried approaching from eastwards, whose
driver bawled snatches of song and puffed his hookah between whiles.
When it reached the crossing, the bailiff shouted:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! whither so early, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To market,&rdquo; the man replied carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose market?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new one, started by Kumodini Babu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got in those baskets of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sweet potatoes, <i>brinj&aacute;ls</i> (egg-plants), and
a lot of other vegetables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you attend Ramani Babu&rsquo;s
market?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it does not pay me to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you used to take your vegetables to Ramani Babu&rsquo;s
market?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but there are hardly any customers left. Now please let
me go; the sun is high up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t obey me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; roared the carter, prodding his oxen viciously.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e592" href="#xd26e592" name=
"xd26e592">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a minute, I tell you! Whose ryot (tenant) are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramani Babu&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you are his ryot and yet are acting against his
interests? If he hears of your perfidy he will certainly turn you out
of his estate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo; asked the fellow, now thoroughly
frightened. &ldquo;I am a very poor man, and Ramani Babu is my father
and mother. He cannot object to my selling a few vegetables wherever I
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does object,&rdquo; rejoined the bailiff sternly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name and residence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&aacute;dhu Sheikh, of Simulgachi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, do you know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; replied S&aacute;dhu, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Ramani Babu&rsquo;s new bailiff, sent with these men to
see that his market is well attended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s tone completely changed. &ldquo;S&aacute;lam,
Babu,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;I did not know who you were. Please let
me pass or I shall be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, friend,&rdquo; shouted the bailiff. &ldquo;Once
for all, are you going to obey me or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&aacute;dhu prodded his bullocks into a lumbering canter; but the
bailiff gave a signal to his clubmen, who ran after him, dragged him
out of the cart, and thrashed him soundly. Then two of them escorted
him, with his wares, to their master&rsquo;s market, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e618" href="#xd26e618" name=
"xd26e618">18</a>]</span>was being held about three miles away. The
bailiff waited at the crossing for new arrivals. They were not long in
coming. A fishwoman, heavily laden, passed by. He hailed her, and on
learning whither she was bound, ordered his men to drag her to their
master&rsquo;s market, which they did, despite the volume of abuse
which she hurled at their heads. In this manner some half a dozen
deserters were captured and escorted to the old market.</p>
<p>The story of his tyranny spread like wildfire through neighbouring
villages, with many amplifications, of course. Kumodini Babu heard that
his rival had arrested a hundred frequenters of his market and was
about to destroy the shelters he had erected for salesmen. This
information filled him with anxiety and, after consulting friends, he
lodged a complaint at the police station. In the remote interior of
Bengal policemen are all-powerful. They usurp authority to which they
are not entitled by law, and use it for private ends. All classes go in
perpetual fear of them; for, by a stroke of the pen, they can ruin
reputations and defeat justice. No one has recourse to their dreaded
agency who can avoid doing so or has the means of gratifying their
greed. By giving a handsome <i>douceur</i> to the Sub-Inspector,
Kumodini Babu obtained a promise of support, which he was simple enough
to rely upon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e625" href="#xd26e625"
name="xd26e625">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meantime Ramani Babu&rsquo;s market bailiff was not idle. Knowing
that he had acted illegally, he resolved to &ldquo;square&rdquo; the
executive. So, one evening, he persuaded his master to accompany him to
the police station, provided with a bundle of ten-rupee currency notes.
After discussing commonplaces with the Sub-Inspector, they adjourned to
an inner room, where they induced him to take their side&mdash;for very
weighty reasons.</p>
<p>Matters now began to look ugly for Kumodini Babu. Every vendor who
approached his market was intercepted. He implored the help of the
Sub-Inspector, who, however, observed a strict neutrality, hinting that
the complainant was at liberty to defend himself with the aid of
clubmen. But Kumodini Babu was a man of peace, and finding the
policeman something less than lukewarm, he resigned himself to the
inevitable.</p>
<p>His evil star continued to prevail, for, soon after these untoward
events, it brought him into collision with the police. In consequence
of an understanding with Ramani Babu, the Sub-Inspector took to buying
provisions from the few shopkeepers who still attended Kumodini
Babu&rsquo;s market and referring them to him for payment. His
constables, too, helped themselves freely to rice and vegetables
without even asking the price, and had their shoes blacked gratis by
Kumodini <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e632" href="#xd26e632" name=
"xd26e632">20</a>]</span>Babu&rsquo;s <i>muchis</i> (leather-dressers).
His bailiff put up with their vagaries, until the shopkeepers came in a
body to say that unless they were stopped, the market would be entirely
deserted. The luckless Zemindar was staggered by the tale of
oppression. He paid for every article extorted by the police, but
strictly forbade the vendors to give any further credit. The
Sub-Inspector was deeply incensed in finding this source of illicit
profit cut off, and his vengeance was perpetrated under the pretence of
law.</p>
<p>One evening, while Kumodini Babu was conning the
<i>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata</i> (an ancient epic) in his parlour, the
Sub-Inspector came in, armed with a search warrant issued by the Deputy
Magistrate of Ghoria, which he showed the astonished master of the
house. A charge of receiving stolen property brought against him was
indeed a bolt from the blue; but when Kumodini Babu regained his
scattered wits, he told the Sub-Inspector scornfully that he might
search every hole and corner of his house. For half an hour the police
were occupied in turning his furniture and boxes topsy-turvy; and at
last the Sub-Inspector went alone into a lumber-room, while his head
constable kept Kumodini&rsquo;s attention fixed on the contents of an
<i>almeira</i> (ward-robe) which he was searching. Shouting, &ldquo;I
have found the property!&rdquo; he emerged from the room with a box
containing various articles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e645"
href="#xd26e645" name="xd26e645">21</a>]</span>of gold and silver,
which he said were hidden under some straw. On comparing them with a
list in his possession he declared that they exactly tallied with
property reported as part of the spoils of a burglary in the
neighbouring village. In vain Kumodini Babu protested his entire
innocence and asked whether he, a respectable Zemindar, was likely to
be a receiver of stolen goods. He was handcuffed and taken to the
police station on foot, while the Sub-Inspector followed in a
palanquin. Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s women-folk filled the house with their
lamentations; and his eldest son, Jadu N&aacute;th, was the first to
recover from the prostration caused by sudden misfortune. He had a pony
saddled and galloped to the railway station, whence he telegraphed to
his uncle, Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu, the pleader, &ldquo;Father arrested:
charge receiving stolen goods&rdquo;. Ghaneshy&aacute;m arrived by the
next train, and after hearing the facts returned to Ghoria, where he
applied to the Deputy Magistrate for bail. There was a strong
disinclination to grant it, owing to the gravity of the charge; but
finally an order was issued, releasing the prisoner on personal
recognisance of Rs. 10,000 and two sureties of Rs. 5,000. The necessary
security was immediately forthcoming, and Kumodini Babu found himself
temporarily a free man, after enduring nearly forty-eight hours of
unspeakable misery in the station lock-up. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e647" href="#xd26e647" name=
"xd26e647">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>In due course his case came on for hearing before the Deputy
Magistrate. Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu secured the services of a fighting
member of the Calcutta bar and was indefatigable in his efforts to
unearth the nefarious plot against his brother. Proceedings lasted for
four days in a court packed with spectators. The Sub-Inspector and his
accomplices told their story speciously enough. A burglary had really
been committed and the jewellery found in Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s
outhouse was proved to have been part of the stolen goods. The issue
was&mdash;who placed them there? On this point the
Sub-Inspector&rsquo;s evidence was not by any means satisfactory. He
finally broke down under rigorous cross-examination, and was forced to
admit that it was quite possible that some one acting on his behalf had
hidden the property in Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s lumber-room. The battle of
the markets was related in all its dramatic details. Shopkeepers and
ryots alike, seeing that justice was likely to prevail, came forward to
depose to acts of tyranny by Ramani Babu&rsquo;s servants and their
allies, the police. Evidence of the prisoner&rsquo;s high character was
forthcoming, while his age and dignified bearing spoke strongly in his
favour. The Magistrate saw that he had been the victim of an abominable
conspiracy and released him amid the suppressed plaudits of the
audience. His reasons for discharge contained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e651" href="#xd26e651" name=
"xd26e651">23</a>]</span>severe strictures on the local police, and
even suggested their prosecution. Thus, after weeks of agonising
suspense and an expenditure on legal fees running into thousands of
rupees, Kumodini Babu was declared innocent. He took the humiliation so
much to heart, that he meditated retiring to that refuge for
storm-tossed souls, Benares. But Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu strongly
dissuaded him from abandoning the struggle, at least until he had
turned the tables on his enemies. So Kumodini Babu moved the District
Magistrate to issue process against Ramani Babu and the Sub-Inspector.
He met with a refusal, however, probably because the higher authorities
thought fit to hush up a glaring scandal which might &ldquo;get into
the papers,&rdquo; and discredit the administration. Ramani Babu,
therefore, was not molested, but his accomplice was departmentally
censured, and transferred to an unhealthy district. Kumodini Babu also
thought of discontinuing the market which had been the fount and origin
of his misfortunes. Here again his brother objected that such a course
would be taken to indicate weakness and encourage further attacks. His
advice was followed. The new market throve amazingly, while Ramani
Babu&rsquo;s was quite deserted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">A Foul Conspiracy.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On a certain morning in February Ramani Babu sprung a
mine on his tenants by circulating a notice among them to the effect
that they would have to pay up every pice of rent on or before the 10th
prox. Some hastened to discharge their liabilities, while others ran
about asking for loans or sat with downcast eyes, unable to decide what
course to take. The English reader is perhaps unaware that every Bengal
landowner is required to pay revenue to Government four times a year,
<i>vis.</i>, on the 28th January, March, June and September. Any one
failing to do so before sunset on these dates becomes a defaulter, and
his estate is put up to auction in order to satisfy the demand, however
small it may be. Property worth many thousands of rupees has often been
sold for arrears of eight annas (a shilling) or even less. The near
approach of these <i>kist</i> (rent) days is of course a period of
great anxiety to landlords; some of whom are forced to borrow the
necessary amount on the security of their wives&rsquo; ornaments.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e665" href="#xd26e665" name=
"xd26e665">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>On March 28th, 18&mdash;, Ramani Babu had to pay about Rs. 10,000 as
land revenue; but his ryots&rsquo; crops had failed, owing to want of
rain, and by the end of February he had been able to realise only Rs.
1,000, the greater portion by threats of force. The Indian
peasant&rsquo;s lot is not a happy one. He depends solely on the
produce of the soil, which yields little or nothing if the annual rains
should fail, or there be an excess of moisture. Millions of cultivators
never know what it is to have a good, solid meal. In order to meet the
landlord&rsquo;s demands they have recourse to a <i>Mah&aacute;jan</i>
(moneylender) whose exactions leave them a slender margin for
subsistence. But religion and ages of slavery render them submissive
creatures. They murmur only when very hard pressed.</p>
<p>S&aacute;dhu Sheikh, of Simulgachi, lived by raising vegetables for
sale in Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s market, until he was forbidden to do so
by Ramani Babu&rsquo;s clubmen. Failing this resource, he abandoned the
little trade; and thus got deeper into the books of his moneylender. At
this crisis he received a written notice ordering him to attend Ramani
Babu&rsquo;s <i>kucheri</i> (office) on 17th March without fail. A
visit to the local moneylender was fruitless and only led to a hint
that old scores must be cleared off. So S&aacute;dhu returned home
crestfallen and determined to abide by his fate. On obeying the
summons, he found Ramani Babu, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e676"
href="#xd26e676" name="xd26e676">26</a>]</span>sitting in his office to
receive rent, which was brought him by a crowd of dejected-looking
ryots. A great hubbub was going on; one Bemani insisting that he had
paid up to date while Ramani Babu&rsquo;s <i>gomastha</i> (bailiff)
stoutly denied the assertion and called n the objector to produce his
receipt. This was not forthcoming for the simple reason that Ramani had
mislaid it. He asked the bailiff to show him the ledger account, and
after spelling through the items laboriously be found that not a pice
stood to his credit, although he had paid nearly sixty rupees since the
last <i>hist</i> (rent) day. There are few who understand the value of
the <i>d&aacute;khilas</i> (rent receipts) which landlords are
compelled by law to give them. The little slips of paper are lost or
destroyed, with the result that many ryots have had to pay twice over.
Bemani vainly invoked Allah to witness that he had discharged his dues;
the bailiff ordered him to pay within twenty-four hours on pain of
severe punishment. Goaded to fury by this palpable injustice the poor
man declined to do anything of the kind. At this stage Ramani Babu
intervened:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You son of a pig, are you going to obey my orders or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have paid once, and I won&rsquo;t pay again,&rdquo;
yelled Bemani, thoroughly roused.</p>
<p>Ramani Babu beckoned to a stalwart doorkeeper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e693" href="#xd26e693" name=
"xd26e693">27</a>]</span>from the Upper Provinces, who was standing
near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarbeshwar, give this rascal a taste of your Sh&aacute;mchand
(cane)!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was zealously obeyed and poor Bemani was thrashed until he lay
writhing in agony on the ground. After taking his punishment he rose,
and looking defiantly at Ramani Babu said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have treated me cruelly; but you will find that there is
a God who watches all our actions. He will certainly deal out
retribution to you!&rdquo; He then turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are not yet cured,&rdquo; exclaimed Ramani Babu.
&ldquo;Let him have another dose of Sh&aacute;mchand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on!&rdquo; roared Bemani, &ldquo;beat me as much as
you please; you&rsquo;ll have reason to repent sooner or later!&rdquo;
With this remark he stood erect, looking fearlessly at his tormentors.
Sarbeshwar administered another welting, which drew blood at every
stroke but was borne without sound or movement. When the doorkeeper
stopped for want of breath, Bemani cast a look of scorn at Ramani Babu
and strode out of the house in silence, full of rage.</p>
<p>Presently another disturbance was heard. One of the ryots had paid
his rent in full but declined to add the usual commission exacted by
the bailiffs, who fell on him in a body and pummelled him severely.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e708" href="#xd26e708" name=
"xd26e708">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>S&aacute;dhu witnessed these horrors from a corner of the room and
inwardly besought Allah to save him from the clutches of those demons.
But Srikrishna, who was the bailiff of his circle, happened to see him
and asked whether he had brought his rent. S&aacute;dhu got up,
sal&aacute;med humbly, and replied, &ldquo;Babuji, you know my present
circumstances well&rdquo;. &ldquo;Answer yes or no,&rdquo; thundered
Srikrishna, &ldquo;I have no time to listen to your excuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant is a very poor man,&rdquo; continued
S&aacute;dhu, shaking from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this person?&rdquo; inquired Ramani Babu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is S&aacute;dhu Sheikh, of Simulgachi,&rdquo; was the
bailiff&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;the very same rascal who gave evidence
against your honour in that faujd&aacute;ri (criminal) case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; roared Ramani Babu. &ldquo;And the son of
a pig owes me rent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, please, do not abuse me, Babuji,&rdquo; protested
S&aacute;dhu, &ldquo;only listen to my tale for one minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you dare to bandy words with me,
<i>haramz&uacute;d&uacute;</i> (bastard)?&rdquo; shouted Ramani Babu,
rising from his seat. &ldquo;Doorkeeper, let him have fifty cuts, laid
on hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swish, swish, swish, sounded the nimble cane, and made a grey
pattern on S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s naked flesh. His screams and prayers
for mercy were mocked by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e728"
href="#xd26e728" name="xd26e728">29</a>]</span>obsequious crowd, and at
length he fell senseless on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, he is shamming,&rdquo; observed Ramani Babu;
&ldquo;drag him outside and souse him with water until he comes
to.&rdquo; The command was obeyed, and when S&aacute;dhu was able to
sit up he was brought back to the dreaded presence. Again his arrears
of rent were demanded, and once more he feebly protested that he could
not discharge them. Thereon Ramani Babu ordered him to be hung up.
Forthwith, a dozen eager hands were laid on him, a rope was passed
under his armpits, and the free end thrown over a rafter of the office.
By this means he was hauled from the ground and swung suspended, a butt
of sarcasm and abuse for Ramani Babu&rsquo;s myrmidons. After enduring
this humiliation for an hour or so, he was let down and a final demand
made on him for the arrears of rent. On his again asserting inability
Ramani Babu ordered his hut to be levelled with the ground and pulse to
be sown on its site, as a punishment for his disobedience. He was then
allowed to leave the scene of his misery.</p>
<p>On reaching home he found Bemani seated in the porch, in expectation
of his arrival. His fellow-victim said that he had lodged an
information against Ramani Babu and his servants at the police station
and intended going to Ghoria, next day, to complain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e735" href="#xd26e735" name=
"xd26e735">30</a>]</span>to the Deputy Magistrate. Would S&aacute;dhu
help him by giving evidence? he asked. &ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; was
the reply, &ldquo;but I must first consult Jadunath Babu, who, I am
sure, will help me.&rdquo; After Bemani&rsquo;s departure S&aacute;dhu
went to his protector and told the story of his sufferings in full.
Jadunath Babu bade him be of good cheer; for he would do all in his
power to bring Ramani Babu to justice. S&aacute;dhu was comforted by
this promise. He returned home and soon forgot all his sorrows in
sleep.</p>
<p>About midnight he was aroused by voices in his yard, and, sallying
forth, discovered a gang of clubmen employed by Ramani Babu, in the act
of tearing the roof from his hut. Remonstrance was met by jeering and
threats of violence; so the luckless man stood helplessly under a
neighbouring tamarind tree, while his house was reduced to a heap of
bamboos and thatch. The material was taken away in carts, the site dug
up, and pulse sown thereon. Thus not a trace of S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s
home was left. He passed the remaining hours of the night under the
tree; and early next morning he called on Jadu Babu, to whom he
unfolded the story of this latest outrage. His patron boiled over with
indignation. He sent S&aacute;dhu to the police station, in order to
lay an information against his persecutors, promising to give him a
house and land to compensate his losses. In less than a fortnight,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e739" href="#xd26e739" name=
"xd26e739">31</a>]</span>the injured man was installed in a new hut and
in possession of enough land to support him comfortably. Then he
settled down, with heartfelt prayers for Jadu Babu&rsquo;s long life
and prosperity. He even sent for his wife and a young sister-in-law,
who had been staying with her brother near Calcutta.</p>
<p>Meantime Bemani had taken out a summons for causing grievous hurt
against Ramani Babu and his servants. When the case came on for hearing
before a Deputy Magistrate at Ghoria, all the accused pleaded
&ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; They could not deny the fact that he had been
beaten within an inch of his life, but alleged provocation on his part,
inasmuch as he had fomented a rebellion among the ryots. Jadu Babu was
not idle. He provided the complainant with first-rate legal advice and
paid all the expenses of adducing witnesses. Emboldened by his support,
at least a dozen of Ramani Babu&rsquo;s ryots who were present while he
was being thrashed, came forward to give evidence of the brutal
treatment he had received and to deny the counter charge brought by the
defendants. Thus the case ended in the conviction of Ramani Babu and
three of his servants, who were sentenced to fines aggregating Rs. 200.
Then the charges preferred by S&aacute;dhu were taken up by the Deputy
Magistrate. As they were of a far graver character, the barrister
brought from Calcutta <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e743" href=
"#xd26e743" name="xd26e743">32</a>]</span>by Ramani Babu obtained a
week&rsquo;s adjournment in order to procure rebutting evidence.</p>
<p>At this time the Muharram festival was in full swing. S&aacute;dhu
was too busy in getting up his case to take part in it; but he sent his
wife to some relatives at Ghoria, while his young sister-in-law, who
was suffering from fever, remained at home. He was aroused one night by
loud screams coming from the hut occupied by this girl. On running out
to see what was the matter, he fell into the arms of a stranger who was
crossing his yard in a desperate hurry. A struggle ensued, but the
intruder managed to escape, not before S&aacute;dhu had recognised him
as a ryot of Ramani Babu, named Karim. On asking his sister-in-law what
had happened, the poor girl told him with many sobs that a man had
broken into the hut, and awakened her by seizing her throat, but had
been scared away by her screams. As soon as day dawned, S&aacute;dhu
ran to the house of Karim&rsquo;s uncle, in the hope of finding him
there. The uncle, however, declared that Karim had been absent since
the previous evening, and on learning the grave charge preferred by
S&aacute;dhu, he begged with folded hands that the scandal might be
stifled, at any cost, for the sake of both families. S&aacute;dhu would
promise nothing, but for obvious reasons he laid no information against
Karim. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e747" href="#xd26e747" name=
"xd26e747">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>Two days later he was engaged on his evening meal, when a
Sub-Inspector appeared. After asking whether his name was S&aacute;dhu,
the policeman slipped a pair of handcuffs on his wrists and turned a
deaf ear to his bewildered request for information as to the charge
preferred against him. Thus he was ignominiously taken to the station
lock-up, followed by a crowd, whom he begged to inform Jadu Babu of his
trouble. The latter was speedily fetched by a compassionate neighbour,
and, after conversing with the police officer, he told S&aacute;dhu
that he was actually charged with murder! Karim&rsquo;s uncle had
informed the police that, his nephew having disappeared since the day
of the alleged trespass, he suspected S&aacute;dhu of foul play. An
inquiry followed which led to S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s transfer to the
district jail.</p>
<p>Jadu Babu was certain that his enemy had instigated the charge, and
knew that he was quite capable of suppressing Karim in order to get
S&aacute;dhu into trouble. He was advised by friends whom he consulted
not to poke his nose into so ugly an affair: but his sense of justice
prevailed. He went to Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu, whom he told the whole
story related by S&aacute;dhu. On learning that Ramani Babu was
implicated, the pleader saw an opportunity of wreaking vengeance on the
persecutor of his brother. Gladly did he undertake the prisoner&rsquo;s
defence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e752" href="#xd26e752" name=
"xd26e752">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>In due course the charge preferred by S&aacute;dhu against Ramani
Babu was heard by a Deputy Magistrate. With Ghaneshy&aacute;m
Babu&rsquo;s aid, the complainant proved it up to the hilt, and all
concerned were heavily fined. Soon afterwards S&aacute;dhu himself
appeared before the Deputy Magistrate to answer a charge of murder. The
circumstantial evidence against him was so strong that he was committed
to the Sessions Court. When brought up for trial there, he astounded
his backers by pleading guilty and offering to point out the spot where
he had buried Karim&rsquo;s corpse. The case was forthwith adjourned
for a local inquiry; and the European District Superintendent of Police
took S&aacute;dhu to the place indicated, where he had the soil turned
up in all directions without result. S&aacute;dhu admitted that he was
mistaken and piloted the police to another spot, where they again
failed to discover any trace of the missing man. On these facts being
reported to the judge, he fixed the morrow for final hearing.</p>
<p>At 11 A.M. he took his seat on the bench in a Court packed with
eager spectators, and was reading a charge to the jury, strongly
adverse to the prisoner, when an uproar was heard outside. Proceedings
were suspended while the judge sent an usher to ascertain the cause;
but ere he returned, half a dozen men burst into the courtroom crying
<i>Dohai!</i> (justice!). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e760" href=
"#xd26e760" name="xd26e760">35</a>]</span>Jadu Babu, who was one of the
intruders, signalled the others to be silent, and thus addressed the
judge with folded hands:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honour, the dead has come to life! Here is Karim, who
was supposed to have been murdered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tremendous sensation in Court. When it subsided the
judge thrust aside his papers and asked for evidence as to
Karim&rsquo;s identity, which was soon forthcoming on oath. Then he
ordered him to be sworn, and recorded the following
deposition:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incarnation of Justice! I will make a full confession,
whatever may happen to me. I was sent for about a month ago by my
landlord Ramani Babu, who ordered me to insult some woman of
S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s household, in order that he might be
excommunicated. In fear of my life I consented to do so, and that very
night I broke into the hut where S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s sister-in-law lay
asleep. Her cries attracted S&aacute;dhu, who grappled with me in his
yard. However, I managed to escape, and on reporting my failure to
Ramani Babu, he sent me in charge of a <i>Barkamd&uacute;z</i> (guard)
to Paliti, which is ten coss (20 miles) away. There I was confined in a
<i>Kacheri</i> (office building) until yesterday, when I got away after
nightfall. I had to pass through Ghoria Bazar, on my way home this
morning, and there I ran up against Jadu Babu, who stopped and
questioned me closely about my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e774"
href="#xd26e774" name="xd26e774">36</a>]</span>movements. There was
nothing for me but to make a clean breast of everything. He took me to
a babu&rsquo;s house where he was staying, and thence brought me to
your honour&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karim&rsquo;s confession took every one by surprise, and it was
corroborated by Jadu Babu in the witness-box. The judge then asked
Sadhu why he pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incarnation of Justice,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;it was
the Daroga Babu (Sub-Inspector of Police) who frightened me into making
a confession. He told me again and again that he had quite enough
evidence to hang me, and advised me to escape death by admitting the
charge of murdering Karim. While I was shut up alone in jail, I had no
one to consult or rely on. Through fear, my wits entirely left me and I
resolved to obtain mercy by making a false confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These circumstances, strange as they may appear to the Western
reader, were no novelty to the Sessions Judge. In charging the jury, he
commented severely on the conduct of the station police and directed
them to return a verdict of not guilty, which they promptly did.</p>
<p>Ghaneshy&aacute;m Babu did not let the matter drop. He moved the
District Magistrate to prosecute Ramani Babu and his bailiff,

with murder. Both were brought to trial and, despite the advocacy of a
Calcutta barrister, they each received a sentence of six months&rsquo;
rigorous imprisonment. Justice, lame-footed as she is, at length
overtook a pair of notorious evil-doers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">Babu Chandra Mohan Bai, or Chandra Babu, as he was
usually called, was a rich banker with many obsequious customers. He
was a short choleric man, very fond of his hookah, without which he was
rarely seen in public. He had no family, except a wife who served him
uncomplainingly, and never received a letter or was known to write one
except in the course of business. His birthplace, nay his caste, were
mysteries. But wealth conceals every defect, and no one troubled to
inquire into Chandra Babu&rsquo;s antecedents. This much was
known&mdash;that he had come to Kadampur fifteen years before my tale
opens with a brass drinking-pot and blanket, and obtained a humbly-paid
office as a clerk under a local Zemindar. In this capacity he made such
good use of the means it offered of extorting money that he was able to
set up as a moneylender at Simulgachi, close to Kadampur. When people
learnt that a new Shylock was at their service, they flocked to him in
times of stress. His usual rate of interest being only 5 per
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e793" href="#xd26e793" name=
"xd26e793">39</a>]</span>cent, per mensem, he cut into the business of
other moneylenders, and in four or five years had no serious competitor
within a radius of four miles from Kadampur itself. Once master of the
situation he drew in his horns, lending money only to people who could
give ample security in land, government papers, or jewellery. He also
started a <i>tej&aacute;rati</i> business (loans of rice, for seed and
maintenance during the &ldquo;slack&rdquo; months, repaid in kind, with
heavy interest, after the harvest). Although few <i>Kh&aacute;taks</i>
(customers) were able to extricate their property from his clutches or
clear off their debit balances, Chandra Babu continued to be in great
request. He was heard to boast that every family in or near Kadampur,
except the Basus, were on his books. The rapid growth of his dealings
compelled him to engage a <i>gomastha</i> (manager) in the person of
Santi Priya D&aacute;s, who had been a village schoolmaster notorious
for cruelty. The duties of his new office were entirely to Santi
Priya&rsquo;s liking, and he performed them to Chandra Babu&rsquo;s
unqualified approval.</p>
<p>On a certain morning in late August, Chandra Babu sat in his office
to receive applications for money or grain. One of his customers named
Karim Sheikh came in and squatted close to the door, after salaming
profoundly. On seeing him Chandra Babu at once remembered that his bond
had run out on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e806" href="#xd26e806"
name="xd26e806">40</a>]</span>15th July, and that he owed nearly Rs.
100, principal and interest. He therefore addressed the newcomer in
accents of wrath. &ldquo;What do you want here, you son of a
pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babuji,&rdquo; pleaded Karim, &ldquo;my stars are unlucky.
You know how wretched the rice harvest has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know all that,&rdquo; replied Santi, who sat near his
master. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old story, when people who can pay
won&rsquo;t pay. Have you brought the money, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karim was obliged to confess he had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why have you come here?&rdquo; roared Chandra Babu.
&ldquo;To show your face, I suppose. We see hundreds of better-looking
fellows than you daily. You have got to pay up at once, you
<i>badm&aacute;sh</i> (rascal).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karim&rsquo;s wrath was stirred by this expression. He replied,
&ldquo;Now, Babu, don&rsquo;t be abusive; I won&rsquo;t stand
it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, do you want to teach me manners, Maulvie Saheb (doctor
learned in Mohammadan law)?&rdquo; asked Chandra Babu
sarcastically.</p>
<p>An exchange of compliments followed which were not altogether to
Shylock&rsquo;s advantage, and at length he roared, &ldquo;Get out of
this office, you rascal, and look out for squalls! I&rsquo;ll sell you
up!&rdquo; Karim left in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e825" href=
"#xd26e825" name="xd26e825">41</a>]</span>high dudgeon, inviting
Chandra Babu to do his worst, and the latter forthwith concocted a
scheme of vengeance with his manager.</p>
<p>Next day Santi obtained a summons against Karim from the Munsiff
(civil judge of first instance) of Ghoria and, by bribing the court
process-server, induced him to make a false return of service. In due
course the suit came on for hearing, and as the defendant was of course
absent, it was decreed against him <i>ex parte</i>. Execution being
also granted, Santi accompanied the court bailiff to Karim&rsquo;s
house, where they seized all his movable property and carried it off to
the Court, leaving him in bewilderment and tears. He was unable to tear
himself away from his gutted home but sat for hours under a tree hard
by, pondering on his ill-fortune. Not until the sun had set and village
cattle began to file in from pasture, did he cast one lingering look on
the scene of his childhood and walk away with a sigh, whither no one
cared to inquire.</p>
<p>A week later, however, Karim strode into Chandra Babu&rsquo;s office
attended by two friends, and counted out ten ten-rupee notes, which he
handed to the moneylender, with a peremptory request to release his
chattels at once. Chandra Babu was greatly surprised by the turn
matters had taken, but he was not the man to let property slip from his
clutches. So he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e835" href=
"#xd26e835" name="xd26e835">42</a>]</span>asked Santi whether the
debtor did not owe a bill of costs. The manager referred to his books
and declared that Rs. 33 8. 0. were still due. Karim planked down the
money without further ado and asked for a receipt, which Santi
reluctantly gave him. Then he again demanded the immediate release of
his property. On receiving an evasive answer, he remarked that Chandra
Babu would hear from him shortly and left the office.</p>
<p>About a month later, Chandra Babu was aroused from sleep in the dead
of night by shouts coming from his inner courtyard. He jumped up and
popped his head out of the window, but withdrew it hastily on seeing
twenty or thirty men running about his premises, with lighted torches,
and shouting&mdash;&ldquo;Loot! loot!&rdquo; Paralysed by fear, he
crawled under the bed and lay in breathless expectation of further
developments. Presently the door was forced open, and a crowd poured
into the room. Chandra Babu&rsquo;s hiding place was soon discovered by
the dacoits (gang robbers), who dragged him out by the legs and
demanded his keys on pain of instant death. Seeing a rusty
<i>talw&aacute;r</i> (sword) flourished within an inch of his throat,
the unhappy man at once produced them, whereon the dacoits opened his
safe and took out several bags of rupees. Then at a signal from their
<i>sardar</i> (leader), they bound Chandra Babu hand and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e845" href="#xd26e845" name=
"xd26e845">43</a>]</span>foot and squatted round him in a circle. The
sardar thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babuji, do you know us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I know you?&rdquo; groaned their victim. &ldquo;Your
faces are blackened and concealed by your turbans. Gentlemen, I implore
you to spare my life! I never injured any of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied the sardar sarcastically; &ldquo;you
have been the ruin of us all. Look you, Chandra Babu, we are all
<i>Kh&aacute;taks</i> (customers) of yours whom you have fleeced by
levying exorbitant interest on loans and falsifying our accounts.
It&rsquo;s no use going to law for our rights; you are hand in glove
with the civil court <i>amla</i> (clerks) and <i>peons</i> (menials)
and can get them to do whatever you wish. So we have determined to take
the law into our own hands. We have made up our accounts and find that
you have extorted from us Rs. 5,000, over and above advances of rice
and cash with reasonable interest. Now we&rsquo;re going to help
ourselves to that sum, besides damages at four annas in the rupee
(twenty-five per cent.). This makes just Rs. 6,250 you owe
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereon the dacoits counted out cash to that amount and no more,
which was placed in bags containing Rs. 1,000 each, ready for removal.
Chandra Babu heaved a sigh of relief, thinking that he had got off
rather cheaply, but his troubles were not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e864" href="#xd26e864" name="xd26e864">44</a>]</span>at an end.
The sardar came close to him and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me carefully: do you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No b&aacute;b&aacute;, but you are my son. Pray, spare my
life! See, I am half dead already and ruined as well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Karim Sheikh,&rdquo; said the sardar impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are,&rdquo; replied Chandra Babu, after recovering
from his intense surprise; &ldquo;but why have you turned
dacoit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was owing to your oppression, which drove me from my
house, and deprived me of the means of livelihood. All my companions
here have been beggared by you, and scores of other families too. The
whole of Kadampur and Simulgachi are clamouring for your blood, and
Allah has appointed me to be the minister of his vengeance. Time was
when I had to cringe to you, just as you are doing to me, but never did
I receive mercy from you. Now the tables are turned. I might kill you,
and who would dare to inform the police folk?&rdquo; (Here Karim made a
vicious prod with his talw&aacute;r, which passed within half an inch
of the terror-stricken victim&rsquo;s throat.) &ldquo;I might put you
out of caste by slaying one of your cows and forcing you to eat its
flesh. You deserve all this and more&mdash;but we will be merciful.
Swear by your goddesses Kali and Durga that you will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e876" href="#xd26e876" name=
"xd26e876">45</a>]</span>never in future demand more than four annas in
the rupee yearly for loans of money or rice. Swear that you will never
again bribe the amla or peons of the Courts; swear that you will never
again falsify the accounts of your Kh&aacute;taks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chandra Babu took the oaths demanded with an appearance of unction
and then implored his captors to release him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; was Karim&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;we must
collect our belongings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he ordered the dacoits to extinguish their torches and
follow him with the bags of money. He led them to a ravine on the river
bank, about a <i>coss</i> (two miles) distant, where the spoil was
equitably divided according to a list of names and amounts due in
Karim&rsquo;s possession. Then after arranging for alibis in case of
criminal proceedings, the band dispersed, well satisfied with their
night&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Chandra Babu&rsquo;s neighbours made no sign until the dacoits were
well out of hearing, when they flocked in to unloose his bonds and
offer hypocritical condolences. The village Chaukidar (watchman) was
sent off to the police station, and next day arrived the Sub-Inspector
with a posse of constables to investigate the dacoity. After recording
the complainant&rsquo;s statement, they endeavoured to secure
additional evidence, but Chandra Babu was so cordially disliked, and
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e890" href="#xd26e890" name=
"xd26e890">46</a>]</span>dacoits&rsquo; vengeance so dreaded, that not
a soul came forward to corroborate his story. Karim was arrested, with
half a dozen accomplices named by Chandra Babu. They had no difficulty
in proving that they were attending a wedding ceremony five miles away
on the night of the alleged dacoity. So the case was reported to
headquarters as false; and Chandra Babu escaped prosecution for
deceiving the police, by giving a heavy bribe to the Sub-Inspector.</p>
<p>His evil star continued in the ascendant. About a week afterwards,
he discovered a heavy deficit in his cash book, kept by Santi Priya,
which that rascal failed to explain, and next day the trusty manager
did not attend office. Indeed he has never been heard of since. This
new calamity was Chandra Babu&rsquo;s &ldquo;last straw&rdquo;. He
hastened to realise outstanding debts and left the village, bag and
baggage, to the intense relief of its inhabitants, who celebrated his
exit by offering <i>puj&aacute;</i> or <i>nam&aacute;z</i> (Mohammadan
prayers) according to the religion they severally professed.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Every good Hindu feels bound to get his daughter or
sister, as the case may be, married before she attains puberty. Rich
people find little difficulty in securing suitable matches for their
girls; but Babu Jadunath Basu, widely known as &ldquo;Jadu Babu,&rdquo;
was not blessed with a large share of this world&rsquo;s goods; and his
sister Basumati was close on her teens. The marriage-broker had
certainly suggested more than one aspirant for her hand, but they were
not to Jadu Babu&rsquo;s liking. As years rolled by, his anxiety
deepened into despair. A match was at length offered which was passably
good, although it did not answer Jadu Babu&rsquo;s expectations. He
learnt from private inquiry that the boy proposed bore a good
character, never mixed with doubtful associates, and had no
constitutional defect. Hindu parents are very careful to ascertain the
health of a suitor, and should they suspect any inherited disease, such
as consumption, they reject him remorselessly. It must not be supposed
that such lads are always doomed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e906" href="#xd26e906" name="xd26e906">48</a>]</span>celibacy, for
their unsoundness may be hidden or counterbalanced by a substantial
money payment.</p>
<p>Jadu Babu found out that the boy had matriculated at Calcutta and
was attending the second year class at a Metropolitan College; more
important still, his father, Amarendra Babu, had money invested in
Government paper, besides a substantial brick
house&mdash;qualifications which augured well for his sister&rsquo;s
wedded happiness. The next step was to invite his own father, Kumodini
Babu, to come from Benares and help him to clinch matters. The old man
pleaded that he had done with the world and all its vanities; so Jadu
Babu had to make a pilgrimage to the Holy City, where he induced
Kumodini Babu to return home with him. Three days later the pair went
to Calcutta with two friends, in order to make the suitor&rsquo;s
acquaintance. They were welcomed by Amarendra Babu, who at once sent
for his son. The boy came in with eyes fixed on the ground and shyly
took a seat near Kumodini Babu. He underwent a severe scrutiny, and at
last the old man broke silence by asking the lad his name. Being
informed that it was Samarendra Nath, he inquired the names of his
father and grandfather, which were promptly given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; observed Kumodini Babu, &ldquo;the times are
so completely out of joint that youths are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e912" href="#xd26e912" name=
"xd26e912">49</a>]</span>ashamed to, utter their father&rsquo;s name,
let alone their grandfather&rsquo;s. Where are you studying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Metropolitan Institution,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent college,&rdquo; said Kumodini Babu; then after a
whispered consultation with Jadu Babu, he said, &ldquo;I am delighted
with Samarendra&rsquo;s modesty and good manners, and have no objection
whatever to giving my daughter to him in marriage&mdash;provided
<i>Prajapati</i> (the Lord of All) causes no hitch&rdquo;. Samarendra
thought that his ordeal was over, but he was mistaken. One of Kumodini
Babu&rsquo;s friends, who happened to be a Calcutta B.A., would not
lose the opportunity of airing his superior learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your English text-books?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackie&rsquo;s <i>Self-culture</i>, Helps&rsquo;
<i>Essays</i>, Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and
Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Enoch Arden</i>,&rdquo; gabbled Samarendra in one
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, now please fetch your <i>Paradise
Lost.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The boy disappeared, returning shortly with a well-thumbed volume,
which the B.A. opened and selected Satan&rsquo;s famous apostrophe to
the Sun for explanation. Samarendra was speechless. After waiting for a
minute, the B.A. asked what text-book he studied in physics and was
told that it was Ganot&rsquo;s <i>Natural Philosophy</i>. He asked
Samarendra to describe an electrophone, whereon the lad began to
tremble violently. Kumodini Babu had pity on his confusion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e947" href="#xd26e947" name=
"xd26e947">50</a>]</span>and told him to run away. Needless to say he
was promptly obeyed.</p>
<p>It has become a Calcutta custom for possible fathers-in-law to
cross-examine suitors on their text-books; but few boys are able to
satisfy the test, however brilliant their acquirements may be. Poor
Samarendra was too overwhelmed with the strangeness of his position to
do himself justice.</p>
<p>When the elder folks were quite alone they plunged into business.
Kumodini Babu sounded his host as to <i>dena paona</i> (settlements) on
either side; but the latter courteously left them entirely to his
discretion. It was settled that Basumati&rsquo;s <i>p&aacute;kk&aacute;
dekh&aacute;</i> (betrothal) should be celebrated on 12th November at
Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s, and that of Samarendra&rsquo;s at his
father&rsquo;s, two days later.</p>
<p>Basumati being an only daughter, Kumodini Babu determined to conduct
her marriage on a magnificent scale. In anticipation of the betrothal
feast, he brought three Brahman cooks from Calcutta to prepare curries,
<i>pillaos</i> and sweetmeats under the supervision of the ladies of
his household.</p>
<p>At length the auspicious day came round. At 5 P.M. Amarendra Babu,
with half a dozen friends, arrived at Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s house from
Calcutta. They were received with great courtesy and conducted to
seats, where a plentiful supply of tobacco <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e967" href="#xd26e967" name=
"xd26e967">51</a>]</span>and betel awaited them. At half-past seven,
Jadu Babu presented the bride-elect to her future family. She looked
charming in a Parsi shawl and Victoria jacket, decked out with
glittering jewels, and sat down near Amarendra Babu, after saluting him
respectfully. He took up some <i>dh&aacute;n, durba</i> and
<i>chandan</i> (paddy, bent grass and sandal-wood paste) and blessed
her, presenting her at the same time with a gold <i>chur</i>
(bracelet). After again saluting him, the timid girl was led back to
the inner apartments. Then the guests were taken to a large hall where
supper was ready for their delectation. Full justice was done to the
repast; and after it was over, they washed their hands in the yard and
smoked or chewed betel in perfect bliss until half-past ten. Then
Amarendra Babu asked leave to return by the last train, declining
hospitality for the night on the plea of previous engagements. While
saying &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; he called Jadu Babu aside and thrust Rs.
30 into his hands, to be distributed among the <i>guru</i> (spiritual
guide), <i>purohit</i> (family priest), and servants. Two days
afterwards, Kumodini Babu and his son went to Calcutta for the
boy&rsquo;s betrothal. He blessed Samarendra, presenting him with a
gold mohur (an obsolete coin worth sixteen rupees) besides Rs. 50 for
the priest and servants of his household. A feast followed on the same
scale as the previous one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e985"
href="#xd26e985" name="xd26e985">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s family priest decided that &Aacute;s&aacute;r
28th would be a lucky day for the wedding, which was to be held at the
bride&rsquo;s great-uncle&rsquo;s house in Calcutta. Early on the 26th,
the Gaih&aacute;lud (turmeric smearing) ceremony took place. Amarendra
Babu rubbed his son&rsquo;s body with a mixture of turmeric and oil and
despatched a supply to Kumodini Babu by his own barber, with
injunctions to have it applied to his daughter&rsquo;s person before 9
A.M., because subsequent hours would be inauspicious. On the
barber&rsquo;s arrival, the ladies of Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s household
anointed Basumati with turmeric and oil and clad her in a gorgeous
wrapper. Then they conducted her to another room where a
<i>j&aacute;nti</i> (instrument for cracking betel-nuts) was given her
and certain <i>nitkits</i> (minor ceremonies) were performed.</p>
<p>At 11 A.M. the presents given on the occasion of the
turmeric-smearing (gaih&aacute;lud) were brought by twenty servants who
were regaled with a feast made ready in anticipation of their arrival.
After partaking of it they were dismissed with a largesse of one rupee
each. During the next two days presents continued to pour in from
relatives of both families.</p>
<p>At length the fateful 28th &Aacute;s&aacute;r dawned, bringing a
mighty commotion in the respective houses. Shouts and laughter echoed
from every side. Amarendra Babu had resolved to marry his son in a
style <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e998" href="#xd26e998" name=
"xd26e998">53</a>]</span>which, sooth to say, was far above his means,
hoping to recoup himself from the large cash payment which he expected
from Kumodini Babu. On his side the latter had consulted relatives as
to the proper dowry. All agreed that Rs. 2,000 worth of ornaments; Rs.
1,001 in cash; Rs. 500 for <i>Barabharan</i> (gifts to a bridegroom);
and Rs. 500 for <i>Ph&uacute;lsajya</i> (lit. a bed of flowers) would
be sufficient. Thus Kumodini Babu provided Rs. 4,001 and imagined that
he was acting generously.</p>
<p>At 7.30 P.M. the bridegroom&rsquo;s procession was formed. A
Sub-Inspector of Police and three constables led the way, followed by a
band of music. Next came a carriage and four conveying Samarendra, his
younger brother, and the family priest. Carriages belonging to
Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s friends, and some hired ones full of invited
guests, brought up the rear. When a start was made, the little police
force hustled vehicles out of the way and even stopped tram-cars when
necessary; while the band tortured selections from Handel and Beethoven
to the intense delight of passers-by, many of whom paused to criticise
shortcomings in the procession among themselves. In about an hour it
reached its destination, where Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s uncle received the
guests. The family barber carried Samarendra in his arms to a chair
which had been provided for him. There he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1008" href="#xd26e1008" name="xd26e1008">54</a>]</span>sat with
eyes fixed steadily on the ground, while his friends squatted round and
cracked jokes at his expense. He smiled, but modestly implored them not
to put him out of countenance. The <i>Lagna</i> (auspicious time) was
determined to be 9.30; meanwhile the guests sat on carpets or chairs,
beguiling the delay with hookahs.</p>
<p>While mirth was at its height, strange things were happening in a
private room adjoining. Soon after arriving, Amarendra Babu asked
Kumodini Babu and Jadunath to display the presents destined for the
young couple. They took him into a room where all were set forth to the
best advantage. After examining them in silence awhile, Amarendra Babu
kicked the nearest contemptuously aside, remarking that they were
&ldquo;mere rubbish&rdquo;. In point of fact he fully expected Kumodini
Babu to give Rs. 4,000 in cash, Rs. 2,000 in respect of Barabharan and
Phulsajya and Rs. 4,000 worth of jewellery&mdash;Rs. 10,000 in all. To
judge by the ornaments shown him, the total dowry would be barely half
as much and he could not help expressing disappointment. On asking
Kumodini Babu what he intended paying down in cash, and learning that
Rs. 1,001 was all he could afford, Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s indignation
knew no bounds. He demanded Rs. 5,000, declaring that if it were not
paid on the nail, he would take his son away! The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1015" href="#xd26e1015" name=
"xd26e1015">55</a>]</span>wretched father implored twelve hours&rsquo;
delay, but was told in as many words that his promise could not be
relied on. The deadlock soon got wind, and Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s
action was severely commented on by the guests, but he remained
obdurate. Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s uncle ran to a wealthy acquaintance for
a loan of Rs. 4,000, but was told that so large a sum was not available
at short notice. On his return, Amarendra Babu delivered his
ultimatum&mdash;Rs. 4,000 cash to be paid forthwith; and finding that
it was hopeless to expect so much, he hailed a cab, hurried Samarendra
into it, and drove home in high dudgeon, followed by all his relatives
and friends. This unexpected calamity brought mourning into a house of
mirth; people spoke in whispers; and anguish left its mark on every
face.</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu was supervising the H&aacute;l&ucirc;ikars
(confectioners) when the awful news reached his ears. For a few minutes
he stood transfixed to the spot; but ere long a happy thought struck
him. He clapped his hands in silent glee, and ran to an inner room,
where Kumodini Babu lay groaning on the bare floor, guarded by his son
who feared that he would do something rash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;Do not take
on like this! God&rsquo;s ways are inscrutable; perchance He has broken
the match off for your daughter&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1021" href="#xd26e1021" name=
"xd26e1021">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, God&rsquo;s will be done,&rdquo; replied Kumodini Babu
in sepulchral tones. &ldquo;We are but His instruments.&rdquo; Then
after a pause he added, &ldquo;What I dread most is loss of
caste&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will dare to excommunicate you for such a trifle?&rdquo;
asked Sh&aacute;m Babu indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, you know too well that my family&rsquo;s position in
society is terribly compromised. A marriage postponed is a marriage
lost!&rdquo; groaned Kumodini Babu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should it be postponed?&rdquo; was Sham Babu&rsquo;s
eager question. &ldquo;I have a proposal to make, if you will only give
it a moment&rsquo;s thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kumodini Babu looked up, and a ray of hope dried his tears; he
waited anxiously for further particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my son Susil, I suppose? He is just sixteen and has
passed the Entrance Examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered Kumodini Babu. &ldquo;He is a fine
lad, obedient and well-mannered. But what has he got to do with our
present fix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give your daughter to him in marriage? I will not
ask a single pice as dowry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kumodini Babu sprang to his feet and embraced Sh&aacute;m Babu with
fervour, saying, &ldquo;You have saved my life. Personally, I should be
delighted to have Susil as a son-in-law, but you must let me consult my
son and wife.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1041" href=
"#xd26e1041" name="xd26e1041">57</a>]</span> He ran to the inner
apartments, and communicated Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s offer to his near
relatives. This unexpected solution of the dilemma filled them with
surprise; and a loud clamour of voices echoed through the house.
Finally all, without exception, agreed that the match would be an
excellent one. Kumodini Babu brought news of its acceptance to
Sh&aacute;m Babu, and it spread among the wedding guests, who were loud
in their praises of his true Hindu spirit.</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu went into the courtyard where Susil sat talking
with some other boys about the astounding piece of good fortune which
awaited him. That he, the son of a humble clerk, should espouse the
daughter of a Zemindar was more than his wildest dreams had
anticipated. He joyfully accompanied Sh&aacute;m Babu to a room, where
he was clad in silken attire, and thence to the hall, where he was
solemnly inducted into the empty bridegroom&rsquo;s chair amid the
acclamations of the assembled guests. As the <i>Lagna</i> (auspicious
time) had not run out the actual marriage ceremony began forthwith.
Basumati was given away by her father; while the ladies performed
<i>Satp&aacute;k</i> (lit. going round seven times&mdash;a ceremony
without which a Hindu marriage is not binding) and other minor
ceremonies with zest. After all had been well and duly gone through,
the bride and bridegroom were conducted to an inner apartment. Susil
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1051" href="#xd26e1051" name=
"xd26e1051">58</a>]</span>underwent the customary &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;
from the ladies, which he bore with great good humour and was at last
left alone with his young companion for life; while some of the fair
guests sang wedding songs to the intense delight of their friends. Nor
were the men-folk idle. They sat down to a sumptuous feast prepared for
the recreant bridegroom&rsquo;s family, nor did they separate till
daybreak.</p>
<p>At 3 P.M. on the morrow Sh&aacute;m Babu took Sasil and Basumati to
his own home, where the <i>Bau-Bh&aacute;t</i> ceremony was performed
in grand style. It was attended by all their caste-fellows, who were
loud in extolling his magnanimity. Sh&aacute;m Babu accepted their
praises meekly, remarking that he had done nothing more than his duty,
by neglecting which he would have rendered himself accountable to God.

<h2 class="main">An Outrageous Swindle</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Amarendra Babu had expected Kumodini Babu to run after
him, with entreaties to return and the promise of a note of hand for
Rs. 4,000. Disappointment became downright wrath when he heard that his
son&rsquo;s prospective bride had been forthwith married to another
boy. After pondering awhile on this grievance, he sent an anonymous
letter to Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s employers, to the effect that their
clerk was robbing them right and left and running a business of his own
with their money, under a fictitious name. They had implicit confidence
in his honesty, and the only action they took was to hand the scrawl to
him with a remark that they hoped he would discover and prosecute the
writer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Amarendra Babu cast about him for a suitable match for his
son. Hearing of a likely girl from the marriage-broker, he visited her
parents, who accepted his overtures with alacrity. The young
lady&rsquo;s father, Jogesh by name, was a commission agent, whose
regular earnings did not exceed thirty <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1066" href="#xd26e1066" name="xd26e1066">60</a>]</span> rupees a
month; but he lived in such style that his neighbours believed him to
be comfortably off. Amarendra Babu, too, was deceived by appearances,
while the girl, who was exhibited to him, seemed intelligent and
pretty. On his side, Jogesh knew his visitor to be a house-owner of
some means; and learning from him that his son was a second-year
student, he gladly consented to the match. The pair next broached a
delicate question, that of dowry. Amarendra Babu had learnt by bitter
experience of the folly of pitching expectations too high. He told
Jogesh that he should be quite satisfied with Rs. 4,001, <i>viz</i>.,
ornaments 2,000, <i>barabharan</i> and <i>phulsajya</i> Rs. 500 each,
and cash Rs. 1,001. On Jogesh&rsquo;s expressing willingness to provide
that amount, the <i>purohit</i> (family priest) was sent for who, after
referring to a <i>panjika</i> (almanac), announced that Sr&aacute;ban
20th would be an auspicious day for the marriage. They then separated
with many protestations of mutual good-will.</p>
<p>Meantime Jogesh made minute inquiries as to Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s
position and the health of his son. Their result was satisfactory
enough; not so the fiasco related in my last chapter, which reached him
with amplification, and made him resolve that Amarendra Babu should not
play such tricks on him. He ordered no ornaments for his daughter,
because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1086" href="#xd26e1086"
name="xd26e1086">61</a>]</span>he had little cash or credit, but simply
borrowed Rs. 300 to meet absolutely necessary expenses. On the
afternoon of Sr&aacute;ban 20th he called in half a dozen city roughs,
armed them with thick sticks, and plied them with spirits, telling them
on no account to appear in the public apartments of his house until
they received a signal agreed on.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock Amarendra Babu, with his son and an uncle
named Rashbehari, arrived at Jogesh&rsquo;s house in a second-class
cab. No procession attended them, partly because the last had cost so
much money, partly owing to the fear that another hitch might cover
them with ridicule. After exchanging hearty salutations with Jogesh,
they asked him to exhibit the ornaments prepared for the bride-elect.
He took them to a side room and left them there a while, presently
introducing a well-dressed man as his family goldsmith. The latter
unlocked a tin box which he was carrying and took out a number of
glittering gold trinkets, one by one. After examining them carefully,
Amarendra Babu asked him to weigh them, which he did, proving that
their weight exceeded 120 <i>bh&aacute;ris</i> (forty-eight ounces),
and their total value, at Rs. 20 per <i>bh&aacute;ri</i>, no less than
Rs. 2,400. This was far more than he had bargained for, and Amarendra
Babu was highly delighted; but his uncle insisted on sending for his
own goldsmith to weigh the ornaments. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1096" href="#xd26e1096" name="xd26e1096">62</a>]</span>Jogesh at
once fell in with the suggestion, and this tradesman, on arrival,
valued them at Rs. 2,700.</p>
<p>Rashbehari Babu&rsquo;s scepticism vanished, and he assented to his
nephew&rsquo;s whispered hint that they need not ask Jogesh to produce
the <i>barabharan</i>. He, however, insisted on satisfying them as to
its worth and placed in their hands a heavy gold watch by McCabe, with
an albert chain, equally ponderous; and assured them that he had paid
Rs. 800 for the two. Amarendra&rsquo;s joy was perhaps excessive, and
when the <i>lagna</i> (auspicious time) came round, he permitted the
marriage to be celebrated. Every ceremony went off without a hitch, and
the evening closed in feasting and mirth.</p>
<p>On the following afternoon Amarendra Babu took the bridegroom and
bride with the box of ornaments to his own home, while Rashbehari Babu
remained behind at Jogesh&rsquo;s to receive the cash. On mentioning
this little formality he was assured that the sum of Rs. 1,001 had been
duly counted out to his nephew; so he took his leave. When he reached
home, he discovered the dirty trick that had been played by Jogesh.
Amarendra stoutly denied having received any cash; and the tin box was
proved to contain only fragments of brick neatly wrapped in paper, and
covered with pink cotton wool.</p>
<p>The pair of dupes hurried to Jogesh&rsquo;s house for an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1110" href="#xd26e1110" name=
"xd26e1110">63</a>]</span>explanation. He sat in the parlour, in
evident expectation of their arrival, and asked with an air of
unconcern what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You son of a pig!&rdquo; roared Amarendra Babu, shaking his
clenched fist close to Jogesh&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;Tell me where are
the ornaments&mdash;where is the cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, did you not take away a box full of trinkets? and you
must admit that the Rs. 1,001 were handed you in a cotton
bag,&rdquo;</p>
<p>This impudence was too much. Both uncle and nephew fell upon Jogesh
and belaboured him sorely with their shoes. He did not retaliate, but
consoled himself with the thought that he had done his duty, to God and
society, by marrying his daughter, whatever fate might await him. After
vowing to bring a suit against the swindler, Amarendra Babu and his
uncle left the premises and did what they would have done much earlier
had they not been in such a desperate hurry to marry the lad. They made
inquiries as to Jogesh&rsquo;s position and soon discovered that he was
a man of straw, quite unworthy of powder and shot. They learned, too,
that he had hired Rs. 3,000 worth of trinkets for one night from a
goldsmith, who never let them out of his possession. From a wealthy
neighbour he had borrowed a McCabe&rsquo;s watch and chain, also for
one night only. His arrangements made with a gang of city roughs, in
order to prevent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1118" href=
"#xd26e1118" name="xd26e1118">64</a>]</span>the marriage being broken
off, also came to light. Amarendra Babu saw that he had been dealing
with a cunning and desperate man and prudently determined to give him a
wide berth in future. But his daughter was in Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s
clutches, and she was forced to expiate the sins of her father. The
luckless girl was kept on very short commons and locked into a dark
room when she was not engaged in rough household work. Contrary to
custom, she was not sent to her father&rsquo;s house three days after
the marriage; nor was the <i>Bau-Bh&aacute;t</i> ceremony performed.
But Jogesh was on the alert; he managed to communicate with her by
bribing a maid-servant, and one morning Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s
household discovered that the half-starved bird had flown.</p>
<p>A year passed away without news of the truants; but, one evening,
Amarendra Babu was sitting in his parlour, spelling out a spicy leader
in the <i>Indian Mirror</i>, when, to his unqualified amazement, Jogesh
stepped in and unbidden took a seat. Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s first
impulse was to shout for help and eject the intruder with every species
of ignominy, but second thoughts are proverbially peaceful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Jogesh,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;must be a very smart
fellow, or he would never have taken us all in as he did. It is better
to be on the side of the sacrificial knife than the goat that awaits
its stroke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1131" href="#xd26e1131"
name="xd26e1131">65</a>]</span>Why should I not hear what he has to
say? He would not have come here without some excellent
reason&mdash;perhaps he wants to pay up part of his debt to me, or
maybe he has some scheme with money in it to unfold. He&rsquo;ll
certainly try to overreach me again; but then once bitten twice shy.
I&rsquo;ll be on my guard.&rdquo; Then with an attempt at irony he
asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you of all people to my house? Have you got
another daughter to marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Amarendra Babu observed the gleam which shot from Jogesh&rsquo;s
shifty eyes, he would have kicked him out at once, but he waited for a
reply, which came in honeyed accents:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Babuji, please don&rsquo;t rake up old stories; what is
done cannot be undone. You, as a father, ought to excuse little
subterfuges, contrived in order to get a daughter off one&rsquo;s
hands. I was so anxious to ally myself with your distinguished family
that I <i>did</i> sail rather near the wind. But I have come to offer
you some amends by putting you on a really good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amarendra Babu&rsquo;s cupidity was excited by these words. He asked
with apparent indifference: &ldquo;Well, let me hear more of your
famous plans, and meantime I&rsquo;ll call for a hookah&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jogesh was overjoyed by the success of his manoeuvres. He answered,
punctuating his sentences <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1146"
href="#xd26e1146" name="xd26e1146">66</a>]</span>by inhaling fragrant
<i>Bhilsi</i>, &ldquo;You have heard of Campbell &amp; Co., the big
cooly recruiters of Azimganj? Well, they have an agency in Calcutta for
supplying emigrants to Mauritius, Trinidad, and other outlandish
places; and it is run by one Ganesh Sen who is a close friend of mine.
He tells me that a number of sub-contracts will be given out to-morrow,
and I have made up my mind to apply for one. Ganesh Babu is sure to
come to terms with me; and I know a very smart <i>sard&aacute;r</i>
(ganger) who will supply me with any number of coolies I want. But I
shall take care to keep a large margin between the rate per head, at
which they will be delivered to Campbell &amp; Co., and that which my
sard&aacute;r will receive. All this will be clear profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a good speculation,&rdquo; said Amarendra Babu
musingly, &ldquo;but I should like to have further particulars. What do
you expect to make per head delivered; and what capital will be
required?&rdquo; Jogesh pulled out a paper covered with calculations,
and proved to his host&rsquo;s satisfaction that as much as Rs. 5 might
be expected on each cooly. As for capital, a few hundreds would be
needed in the first instance as an advance to the sard&aacute;r, and
other sums later, to provide outfits for the coolies according to law.
Campbell &amp; Co. settled the accounts of sub-contractors monthly, so
that Amarendra would not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1156" href=
"#xd26e1156" name="xd26e1156">67</a>]</span> have to wait long for his
money. Jogesh concluded by urging his <i>baib&aacute;hik</i> (father of
a son-in-law) to call with him on Messrs. Campbell &amp; Co.&rsquo;s
Calcutta manager, who would corroborate his statements. Amarendra Babu
thought that there would be no harm in going into matters further. He
fixed 4 P.M. on the following day for a visit to 809 Strand, where
Campbell &amp; Co.&rsquo;s branch offices were said to be located.</p>
<p>On arriving there punctually, he was met by Jogesh, who took him
through a courtyard where twenty or thirty coolies were squatting,
shepherded by a stalwart Mohammadan, wearing a blue turban, who was
introduced as Salim Sard&aacute;r, his ganger. Pushing through the
little crowd, they entered a well-furnished office, where several
clerks sat writing busily. One of them looked up when Jogesh said:
&ldquo;Ganesh Babu, I have brought you my <i>baib&aacute;hik</i>, who
is thinking of joining me in a sub-contract&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The manager, for such he was, received Amarendra Babu politely and
said that he would gladly come to terms with them. He then produced a
written contract in duplicate on stamped paper, by which the partners
agreed to furnish at least 1,000 coolies monthly, during the emigration
season, at rates which left a net profit of Rs. 5 per head, to be
shared equally between them. After reading both documents over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1168" href="#xd26e1168" name=
"xd26e1168">68</a>]</span>twice, Amarendra Babu executed them, as did
Jogesh; and the former took possession of his copy. On returning home
with his new partner, he entered on a discussion as to ways and means.
It was agreed that he should advance Rs. 5,000 for preliminaries, which
he did a week later, raising the amount on a mortgage of his Calcutta
house property. Everything went swimmingly at first; Jogesh calling
daily to report progress; and a month later he burst into Amarendra
Babu&rsquo;s parlour, with a cash-book and bundle of currency notes.
The latter learnt to his intense delight that his share of the profits
amounted to Rs. 1268 12.4. which was promptly paid him. Two or three
days afterwards Jogesh again called to tell him that an opportunity of
making Rs. 10,000 net had occurred owing to the pressing demand for
cooly freight from a ship which was lying half-empty, and costing large
sums for demurrage. Rs. 10,000 must be forthcoming at once for advances
and perhaps special railway trucks, but Amarendra Babu might calculate
on receiving 100 per cent. in three weeks at the latest. Such a chance
of money-making was not to be lost. Amarendra Babu rushed off to his
broker and sold nearly all his Government paper for Rs. 10,000 in cash,
which he handed to Jogesh, against a formal acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Seeing nothing of his partner for several days, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1172" href="#xd26e1172" name=
"xd26e1172">69</a>]</span>Amarendra called to inquire how the new
contract fared and was thunderstruck to find Jogesh&rsquo;s house
locked up. Hastening to Campbell &amp; Co.&rsquo;s Strand offices, he
saw a notice &ldquo;to let&rdquo; exhibited there. This spectacle
confirmed his worst fears&mdash;he had been twice swindled
outrageously. His only hope lay in the scoundrel&rsquo;s arrest; so he
laid an information at the police station, and a clever detective was
told off to investigate the charge. Strange was the story which came to
light. No such firm as &ldquo;Campbell &amp; Co.&rdquo; existed; Ganesh
Babu and Salim Sard&aacute;r were both accomplices of Jogesh, who had
rented an office on the Strand for one month at Rs. 300 which was never
paid. He had also engaged twenty or thirty loafers at 4 annas (4d.) a
head to personate coolies for a couple of hours. This part of the
inquiry was satisfactory enough&mdash;for the police; not so the
efforts they made to trace Jogesh and his accomplices. From that day to
this nothing has been heard of them.</p>
<p>Amarendra Babu never recovered from this crushing blow. The loss of
nearly Rs. 14,000 is a very serious matter for any one of moderate
means; to him it was doubly grievous, for he worshipped money and
valued nothing but success. By constantly brooding on his misfortunes
and folly he developed symptoms of madness and was at times so violent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1177" href="#xd26e1177" name=
"xd26e1177">70</a>]</span>that his relatives were obliged to confine
him in a dark room. One afternoon he eluded their vigilance and hurried
to the office of &ldquo;Campbell &amp; Co.&rdquo; on the Strand. After
gazing for several minutes at the empty building, he heaved a deep
sigh, ran across the road, and sprang into the River Hughli. The
undercurrent sucked his body in, and it was never recovered. Perhaps
Mother Ganges was loath to keep a carcase so tainted in her bosom, and
so whirled it southwards to the ocean. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sh&aacute;m Babu was a clerk of nearly thirty
years&rsquo; standing, and the approach of old age made him anxious to
escape from the daily grind of business. He asked permission to resign,
which was reluctantly granted; his employers signifying their
appreciation of his faithful service by granting him a pension of Rs.
30 a month and offering to provide for any of his relatives who might
be fit for clerical work. Sh&aacute;m Babu thanked them warmly and
retired to his native village, with the intention of passing the
evening of life in peace. He had always lived well within his means.
People who were thrice as rich could not imagine how he contrived to
bring up a family on the salary which he was known to enjoy. Some folks
insinuated that he had made money by giving his son in marriage to
Kumodini Babu&rsquo;s daughter, never remembering that a dowry is
reserved for the bride&rsquo;s benefit, while the cash payment made to
a father-in-law barely suffices to meet the expenses of elaborate
nuptial ceremonies. Others hinted that he had waxed rich on illicit
commissions&mdash;another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1185"
href="#xd26e1185" name="xd26e1185">72</a>]</span>charge which was quite
without foundation. Sh&aacute;m Babu was strictly honest, and besides,
the opportunities within the reach of clerks employed by a private firm
are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>After settling down at Kadampur he cudgelled his brains for some
means of increasing his slender resources. Friends advised him to try
farming, or start a business in lending grain to cultivators. Neither
trade was to his liking. Clerks are of little use outside their own
sphere; and Sh&aacute;m Babu was too soft-hearted to succeed as a
village Shylock. A matter of pressing importance was to establish his
son Susil, who had passed the First Arts examination and was hanging
about the Government offices at Ghoria, in the hope of securing a post.
Sh&aacute;m Babu took advantage of his late employer&rsquo;s offer and
sent the young man off to Calcutta armed with a sheaf of certificates.
To his great delight, Susil was appointed clerk on Rs. 25&mdash;a
magnificent start, which relieved his father&rsquo;s most pressing
anxiety.</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu had begun life with a small patrimony which was
slowly increased by savings from his monthly pay. He was worth nearly
Rs. 10,000, the whole of which was lent by him to a trader named
Gop&aacute;l Datta, certified by Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s
brother-in-law Hari to be thoroughly trustworthy. This Gop&aacute;l
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1191" href="#xd26e1191" name=
"xd26e1191">73</a>]</span>dealt in jute; and being a man of great
daring, he speculated so successfully with Sh&aacute;m Babu&rsquo;s
money that, within three or four years, he amassed a fortune of two
lakhs (&pound;13,333). He paid 12 per cent. interest on the loan
regularly, which made a comfortable addition to Sh&aacute;m
Babu&rsquo;s pension.</p>
<p>It was the latter&rsquo;s habit to visit his Calcutta relatives at
least once a month. So, one day in June, 18&mdash;, he went to Hari
Babu&rsquo;s house with the intention of passing the night there. His
brother-in-law was absent and not expected till the morrow; but
Sh&aacute;m Babu was welcomed by the ladies of the family, who made all
arrangements for his comfort. In the evening he sat in the Baitakhana
(parlour) reading the <i>Bhagavat Gita</i> (a mystical poem). A
carriage drove up to the door whence alighted R&aacute;man&aacute;th
Babu, who was Gop&aacute;l&rsquo;s younger brother. After the usual
compliments had been exchanged, Sh&aacute;m Babu asked what business
his visitor was engaged in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have started as a broker in jute and oil-seeds,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will do as well as Gop&aacute;l,&rdquo; said
Sh&aacute;m Babu, &ldquo;but I suppose you have joined him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied R&aacute;man&aacute;th
impulsively; then he checked himself, as though he had said too
much.</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu was astonished by the tone adopted by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1206" href="#xd26e1206" name=
"xd26e1206">74</a>]</span>his visitor. He asked, &ldquo;Why,
what&rsquo;s the matter with Gop&aacute;l, nothing wrong I hope and
trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly; but I&rsquo;m in a hurry to-day, you must
excuse my taking leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu, however, would not be put off with vague
insinuations. He said, &ldquo;I must ask you, R&aacute;man&aacute;th,
to be more precise. You know your brother has borrowed Rs. 10,000 from
me on a mere note of hand, and I am naturally very anxious to learn the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>R&aacute;man&aacute;th Babu paused for a few seconds before
replying. &ldquo;It is a fact that my brother&rsquo;s speculations have
been unfortunate of late. He certainly made a good deal of money at one
time, but sunk the bulk of it in bricks and mortar, which you know are
not easily turned into liquid capital. You, as a large creditor, ought
to be told how the land lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first I have heard of Gop&aacute;l&rsquo;s
difficulties,&rdquo; groaned Sh&aacute;m Babu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because no one troubled himself to tell you the truth;
but I can assure you that Gop&aacute;l&rsquo;s liabilities are
something awful, and it is quite possible that he may have to take
insolvency proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! What shall I do? If Gop&aacute;l
becomes bankrupt, I shall be utterly ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I cannot advise you fully,&rdquo; replied
R&aacute;man&aacute;th Babu, &ldquo;but forewarned is forearmed. If I
were in your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1223" href="#xd26e1223"
name="xd26e1223">75</a>]</span>shoes I would certainly call in my
loan.&rdquo; Thereon he took leave.</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu passed a restless night, dreaming of the
debtor&rsquo;s jail and a starving family. On Hari Babu&rsquo;s return,
next morning, he related the purport of his conversation with
R&aacute;man&aacute;th. His host said: &ldquo;You should not attach too
much importance to such tittle-tattle. R&aacute;man&aacute;th has had a
quarrel with his brother about family matters, and he is not at all
averse to doing him a bad turn.&rdquo; Sh&aacute;m Babu was not
satisfied with this explanation. He answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe R&aacute;man&aacute;th capable of
telling deliberate lies, which must inevitably be detected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. It is quite possible that Gop&aacute;l may be in
temporary straits. But can you point to a single merchant among your
acquaintances whose career has been uniformly prosperous? There are ups
and downs in commerce, which no one can avoid. Mark my words,
Gop&aacute;l will soon pull himself together again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu was by no means convinced by his
brother-in-law&rsquo;s optimism. He remarked, &ldquo;In any case I
ought not to allow my loan to stand without some tangible security.
Gop&aacute;l has house property in Calcutta, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure he has. There is his new house at Entally, which
must have cost Rs. 20,000; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1235"
href="#xd26e1235" name="xd26e1235">76</a>]</span>another in Barabazar,
letting at Rs. 3,000. Just calculate what this property must be worth.
If I doubted Gop&aacute;l&rsquo;s solvency, do you suppose I would have
lent him Rs. 20,000 on his note of hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu was quite reassured. He came to the conclusion that
R&aacute;man&aacute;th had attempted to injure his own brother, and
returned home with a firm resolve to disregard such scandalous talk in
future.</p>
<p>About three months afterwards he met R&aacute;man&aacute;th Babu
quite casually in Harrison Road and, in the course of conversation, the
latter asked whether he bad called in his loan to Gop&aacute;l.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done nothing of the kind,&rdquo; was the curt reply.
&ldquo;My brother-in-law tells me that he is quite solvent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just like him to say so&mdash;the selfish fellow! I am
sorry to say that my brother has lost heavily by speculating in jute
and is, in fact, a ruined man. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, ask Hari
Babu again and you will see what tune he sings. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t
know that he has called in his loan of Rs. 20,000?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is certainly strange,&rdquo; replied Sh&aacute;m Babu
with tears in his voice. &ldquo;He never breathed a word of any such
intention to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hari Babu is your brother-in-law,&rdquo; continued
R&aacute;man&aacute;th, &ldquo;but Gop&aacute;l is my own brother. Is
it likely that I would injure his reputation gratuitously? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1250" href="#xd26e1250" name=
"xd26e1250">77</a>]</span>No; you are an old friend whom I cannot allow
to be ruined without a word of warning. If you do not choose to act
upon it, so much the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu was now convinced that no time was to be lost in
demanding proper security for the loan. He went straight to his
brother-in-law, to whom he repeated the information which he had
received.</p>
<p>Hari Babu shook his head sadly. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
am afraid there is some truth in it. Gop&aacute;l is in temporary
difficulties; but you need not be anxious. I will get him to give you a
mortgage on landed property worth much more than his debt to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu felt somewhat reassured, but there was a point to
be cleared up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you called in your
loan of Rs. 20,000?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hari Babu looked at him suspiciously. &ldquo;Who told you
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it from a reliable source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been R&aacute;man&aacute;th, who is always
seeking to make mischief. Well, yes, I did ask Gop&aacute;l to repay
me, not that I distrusted him but because I wanted to invest the money
in land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu felt indignant at the man&rsquo;s gross
selfishness, but he concealed his feelings and merely remarked that he
would not leave Calcutta till the mortgage was settled. Next morning he
insisted on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1269" href="#xd26e1269"
name="xd26e1269">78</a>]</span>Hari Babu accompanying him to
Gop&aacute;l&rsquo;s house at Entally. They found the debtor apparently
in high spirits, although he admitted that certain speculations had
turned out badly. When pressed by Sh&aacute;m Babu to repay the loan,
he asked for time, pleading that his whole capital was locked up.
Sh&aacute;m Babu, however, was obdurate, and with his
brother-in-law&rsquo;s help he brought such pressure to bear on
Gop&aacute;l that the latter sulkily agreed to give him a mortgage on
an ancestral estate in the <i>Mufassil</i> (interior of Bengal).
Sh&aacute;m Babu stuck closely to him until the bargain had been
fulfilled, and managed matters so expeditiously that the mortgage deed
was drawn up, executed, and registered in a week. Though he had now
something tangible to rely on in case of accidents still he was not
happy, for Gop&aacute;l discontinued paying interest on the loan and he
did not dare to press him, lest he should precipitate a crash.</p>
<p>Misfortunes never come singly. Soon after settling this unpleasant
affair, Sh&aacute;m Babu was laid low by fever; and doctor&rsquo;s
bills trenched sadly on his slender resources. Susil, too, the hope of
the family, caught a mysterious disease and was absent from office so
long that his employers were obliged to replace him. For the first time
in his life, the poor old father felt the pinch of want, but he bore up
bravely hoping for better times. When he was able to crawl about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1276" href="#xd26e1276" name=
"xd26e1276">79</a>]</span>again, he applied to his old employers for
work of any kind, but learnt to his sorrow that they intended winding
up the business and were not able to increase their establishment.
Sh&aacute;m Babu scanned the advertisement columns of the daily paper
and answered many offers of employment, learning, on each occasion,
that he was far too old to fill the coveted post.</p>
<p>One evening he sat in his parlour brooding over the many misfortunes
which encompassed him. A distant connection named Srish Babu came in
and, hearing that his host sorely needed work, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to start a business in country produce and shall
want several experienced clerks. I must provide for relatives first and
strangers afterwards. Now, would you be inclined to come to me as
manager, on Rs. 75 a month to begin with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sh&aacute;m Babu jumped at the offer, which would restore him to
comparative affluence, and it was agreed that he should enter on his
new duties in three weeks. A month passed by without news from his
relative, and meantime Sh&aacute;m Babu received a tempting offer of
employment. Before deciding what to do he wrote to Srish Babu,
informing him of the fact and asking whether he could rely on him. A
reply came to the effect that he might do as he pleased, but that the
business in country produce, which he was to manage, would positively
be started in a fortnight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1284"
href="#xd26e1284" name="xd26e1284">80</a>]</span>After another month of
suspense, Sh&aacute;m Babu learnt that Srish&rsquo;s bubble had been
pricked, and that he had levanted, no one knew whither, to escape a
swarm of creditors.</p>
<p>The poor old man was now on his beam-ends. The only course open to
him was to sue Gop&aacute;l for arrears of interest and foreclose his
mortgage. After a year and a half&rsquo;s attendance in divers civil
courts and spending his last rupee on lawyers&rsquo; fees, he obtained
a decree. When, however, he tried to execute it, it turned out that the
estate on which he had a lien was a joint family possession, with the
shares so inextricably mixed up that he could neither trace the
property mortgaged to him nor discover who was liable for the
proportion of profit derived from it. As well poke one&rsquo;s fingers
into a hornet&rsquo;s nest as into a joint family estate! Sh&aacute;m
Babu was glad to accept an offer of Rs. 5,000 from Gop&aacute;l&rsquo;s
co-sharers, in return for a surrender of his claims. Despite his heavy
loss, enough remained to preserve him from penury; and he was even able
to start Susil in a small way of business. Great is the virtue of
economy! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1288" href="#xd26e1288"

<h2 class="main">A Peacemaker.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Young Samarendra Dass of Calcutta hoped to enter
Government service as a Sub-Deputy Magistrate; but this ambition was
thwarted by the sudden decease of his father, who left a widow and two
sons entirely unprovided for. After dutifully performing the
<i>sr&aacute;dh</i> (funeral rites), he waited on the dead man&rsquo;s
uncle, Rashbeh&aacute;ri Babu by name, with a request that he would
support the little family until the sons were in a position to do so.
No good Hindu in comfortable circumstances ever turns a deaf ear to
such appeals. Rashbeh&aacute;ri Babu at once invited the trio to take
up their abode with him. Having no nearer relatives, he had resolved to
leave his whole fortune to Samarendra and his brother Nagendra; and
long before his nephew&rsquo;s death he had executed a will to that
effect, which for obvious reasons was kept a profound secret. The young
men were, therefore, ignorant of the brilliant prospects in store for
them, and worked hard to prepare themselves for earning a livelihood.
Samarendra was soon provided with a post as clerk, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1297" href="#xd26e1297" name=
"xd26e1297">82</a>]</span>yielded enough to provide the cost of his
father&rsquo;s funeral ceremony and also enabled him to pay
Nagendra&rsquo;s school fees.</p>
<p>One evening Rashbeh&aacute;ri Babu went to bed supperless,
complaining of indisposition. At midnight, Samarendra was awakened by
his groans and found him writhing in agony on the floor. A doctor was
summoned in hot haste; but ere his arrival the poor old man had expired
in Samarendra&rsquo;s arms. His case was diagnosed as one of failure of
the heart&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Samarendra and his mother were prostrated by this sudden calamity;
but there is no time to be lost in hot weather. Calling in three or
four neighbours, they had the body carried to Nimtala Ghat for
cremation. Sufficient money was given to the <i>Muchis</i> (low-caste
men who serve as undertakers) for purchasing an abundant supply of fuel
and <i>ghi</i> (clarified butter) with which a <i>chilla</i> (pyre) was
constructed. After the corpse had been laid reverently thereon,
Samarendra performed <i>Mukhagni</i> (&ldquo;putting fire in its
mouth,&rdquo; the duty of the eldest son or nearest relative). Fire was
then applied on four sides, and when the body had been reduced to
ashes, Samarendra bathed in the Ganges with his companions, and
returned home with wet clothes, shouting &ldquo;Haribol!&rdquo; (a cry
used at funerals).</p>
<p>Next day Samarendra discovered the dead man&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1317" href="#xd26e1317" name=
"xd26e1317">83</a>]</span>keys, one of which opened a drawer where
Rashbeh&aacute;ri Babu kept his private papers. Among them was a will,
which made himself and his brother sole heirs to the deceased&rsquo;s
estate. He ran with the glad news to his mother, who, in the exuberance
of her joy, vowed to offer a sumptuous <i>puj&aacute;</i> at Kali
Gh&aacute;t temple after the <i>sr&aacute;dh</i> had been duly
performed.</p>
<p>Rashbeh&aacute;ri Babu left landed property yielding an annual
income of Rs. 1,200, besides Rs. 10,000 deposited in a Calcutta bank,
and a substantial house. His estate was worth not less than Rs.
40,000&mdash;a lucky windfall for the penniless brothers. It is
needless to add that the testator&rsquo;s <i>sr&aacute;dh</i> was
celebrated with great pomp, which over, Samarendra applied for and
obtained probate of the will. A sudden change from dependence to
comparative wealth is trying to the best-balanced character.
Samarendra&rsquo;s head was turned by the accession of fortune; he
began to give himself airs in dealing with acquaintances, and was not
over-kind to his mother, who bore her sufferings patiently.</p>
<p>A landed proprietor holds service in contempt. Samarendra at once
resigned his post and settled down at Ratnapur, where Rashbeh&aacute;ri
Babu had owned a house and the bulk of his estate was situated. Soon
afterwards he yielded to the repeated advice of his mother by marrying
the daughter of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1332" href=
"#xd26e1332" name="xd26e1332">84</a>]</span>caste-fellow, endowed with
goods on a par with her husband&rsquo;s new position.</p>
<p>His brother Nagendra passed the Entrance Examination, but failed to
secure a First Arts certificate. This rebuff so disheartened him that
he gave up all idea of continuing the University course and returned to
Ratnapur with the intention of living in idleness on his property. In
vain did Samarendra point out the advantages of a degree. Nagendra
declared that such distinctions were beyond his reach. Sudden wealth,
in fact, was injurious to both of them.</p>
<p>Two uneventful years passed away. Samarendra&rsquo;s wife was the
mother of an idolised boy and was herself adored by her mother-in-law,
who never allowed her to do any manner of household work. The result
was that her temper changed for the worse. When the old lady fell ill,
the young one made horrible messes of her curry and rice. If her
husband ventured to remonstrate, she silenced him with abuse, and even
emphasised her remarks with a broomstick.</p>
<p>Samarendra, in fact, was completely under his wife&rsquo;s thumb.
Her word was law in the household; her mother-in-law a mere cypher, who
found both husband and wife perpetually leagued against her. Shortly
after his arrival at Ratnapur, Nagendra espoused the daughter of Kanto
Babu, a Zemindar residing in the neighbourhood. At first
Samarendra&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1340" href=
"#xd26e1340" name="xd26e1340">85</a>]</span>wife received the new-comer
graciously enough; but finding that she was of a submissive
disposition, she soon began to lord it over her sister-in-law. Nagendra
sympathised heartily with his young wife, but had such a horror of
family quarrels that he was very loath to intervene on her behalf. One
evening, however, he ventured on a word of reproof, which was received
with angry words and threats of his eldest brother&rsquo;s
vengeance.</p>
<p>Next day Samarendra called him into the parlour, and, after they
were seated, said: &ldquo;I hear you have been rude to <i>Barabau</i>
(the elder wife). Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra raised his hands in wonder. &ldquo;No, brother, it was she
who showed disrespect to me, simply because I objected to her bullying
my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that <i>Barabau</i> has lied?&rdquo;
thundered Samarendra. His brother was nettled by the tone adopted. He
replied hotly, &ldquo;Yes, she has lied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; asked Samarendra beside himself with
indignation. &ldquo;Is my wife a liar and are you a Judisthir?&rdquo;
(the elder of the five Pandav brothers, heroes of the Mahabharata).
&ldquo;You are a creature without shame!&rdquo; So saying, he shook his
fist at Nagendra who started from his seat as if to attack him. Luckily
a respectable neighbour came in at the very nick of time and separated
the would-be combatants. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1357" href=
"#xd26e1357" name="xd26e1357">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the morrow, Nagendra told his brother curtly that these perpetual
bickerings must be avoided at all cost, and that the only course open
to them was to separate. Samarendra raised not the slightest objection,
and from that day forward two distinct establishments were set up in
the same house. It only remained to divide the estates equally, and as
a preliminary step Nagendra asked for accounts during the last three
years. They were furnished in a few weeks, and he spent several nights
in examining them carefully, taking lists of defaulters in order to
verify them by independent inquiry.</p>
<p>While returning home, one evening, from supper at a friend&rsquo;s
house, he met a Mohammadan ryot who, according to the accounts, was
heavily in arrears of rent. He paused and, after acknowledging the
man&rsquo;s sal&aacute;m, remarked that he ought to make an effort to
pay a part at least of what was due. The ryot stood aghast with
surprise, but invoked Allah to witness that he had paid up every pice,
adding that he held <i>D&aacute;khilas</i> (rent receipts) from <i>Bara
Babu</i> (the elder brother) which would prove his assertion. Nagendra
asked him to call next day with the receipts in question.</p>
<p>When the man presented himself, Nagendra, in his brother&rsquo;s
presence, asked for the arrears of rent shown in the <i>jam&aacute;
w&aacute;sil b&aacute;qi</i> (accounts). Again the ryot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1373" href="#xd26e1373" name=
"xd26e1373">87</a>]</span>affirmed that he owned nothing and appealed
to the <i>Bara Babu</i> for corroboration. Samarendra was taken
aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;you did pay me something
about a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;something,&rsquo; Babu? You know quite
well that I discharged my rent in full; and what is more I have
receipts.&rdquo; So saying he untied a knot in his <i>gamcha</i>
(wrapper) and extracted some greasy papers, which he flourished in
Samarendra&rsquo;s face, shouting, &ldquo;Will you swear by your gods
that these are not in your writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra took the receipts, which bore his brother&rsquo;s
signature. The latter looked somewhat sheepish as he answered:
&ldquo;My memory failed me; I now recollect receiving our rent from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra turned sharply on his brother with the question:
&ldquo;Then why did you not enter these receipts in your <i>karcha</i>
(cash-book)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;probably I forgot to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Nagendra said nothing at the time, his doubts of
Samarendra&rsquo;s probity became certainties. From that day onward he
was indefatigable in studying the copy of the <i>siah</i> (rent-roll)
furnished him, the cash-book, and statement of arrears. Figures set
down in these accounts were checked by private <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1400" href="#xd26e1400" name=
"xd26e1400">88</a>]</span>inquiries among the ryots themselves. Then
the truth dawned on Nagendra, that his brother had misappropriated
large sums, which should have been paid to him, and concealed his fraud
by falsifying the Zemindari papers. After preparing a list of
defalcations, he showed it to his brother and asked for an explanation.
None was forthcoming; nay, Samarendra made his case worse by flying
into a passion and ordering him out of the room. He went straight to
Kanto Babu for advice, and was told that the only course open to him
was to sue his brother for recovery of the amount wrongfully
appropriated. He resolved to do so forthwith.</p>
<p>On the self-same night his wife, after discussing household affairs
with him as usual, asked casually why he had paid her father a visit.
He told her everything that occurred without reserve. The young lady
listened with breathless attention, but heaved a deep sigh on learning
that he intended suing his elder brother. Nagendra paused and asked
what was on her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; was her reply, &ldquo;I am only a woman,
knowing nothing of the world except things within my sphere. Any
attempt on my part to meddle in business matters may seem extremely
presumptuous. But this is such a grave and risky matter that I cannot
help speaking out. If you file a suit against your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1406" href="#xd26e1406" name=
"xd26e1406">89</a>]</span>brother, he will of course defend himself;
for to lose it would ruin him in purse and honour. It will drag on for
months. If you get a decree, the defendant will appeal to the
Sub-Judge, and eventually to the High Court. To fight your way step by
step will cost a fortune; and even should you win all along the line,
the lawyers will not leave you enough to keep body and soul together.
How can a small estate like yours bear the costs of both sides? So in
my humble opinion it would be much better to allow your brother to
enjoy his ill-gotten gains. Make up your mind, from this day forward,
to look carefully after your interests, and you may rest assured that
your brother will never try any such tricks again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra listened with open mouth to this discourse, and when his
wife had done speaking, he embraced her fondly again and again,
murmuring:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest love, I never knew your real worth till now. The
Goddess of Wisdom has chosen you as her messenger and has convinced me
that lawsuits are luxuries which only the rich folk can enjoy&mdash;not
people in my position. I will certainly see your father to-morrow and
tell him my resolve to take no steps whatever against
Samarendra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Hindu wife is her husband&rsquo;s truest friend; ever eager to
share his sorrows and to proffer sound advice in times of difficulty.
Yet these sweet, unselfish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1414"
href="#xd26e1414" name="xd26e1414">90</a>]</span>creatures are
systematically libelled by men who owe everything to them. It was soon
noised abroad that Nagendra&rsquo;s wife had saved him from inevitable
ruin. Everyone praised her common-sense&mdash;not excepting Samarendra
and his wife, who thenceforward treated her with more consideration.
Nagendra, therefore, began to hope that peace and unity would again
rule the family. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1416" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Despite his lack of training Samarendra Babu had great
capacities for business, and seldom lost a chance of profit-making. He
saw that people around him stood in constant need of funds to defray
the cost of religious and family rites, and were ready to pay 60 per
cent for loans&mdash;at least they undertook to do so. It occurred to
him that if he lent money on unimpeachable security at something under
the market rates, he could not fail to make a large fortune. Soon after
he had set up as a banker, the neighbours flocked to him for advances,
which he granted only to such as could offer substantial security; his
charges by way of interest being 30 to 40 per cent. He also started a
business in lending ryots rice for their seed-grain and support till
the harvest should be reaped. It is needless to add that his clients
paid heavily for this accommodation. So rapidly did his dealings
increase that he sought an agent to represent him at the district
headquarters; and particularly to buy up defaulters&rsquo; estates at
the auctions which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1422" href=
"#xd26e1422" name="xd26e1422">92</a>]</span>are held periodically under
Government auspices. His choice fell upon one Bipinbeh&aacute;ri Bhur,
who had a widespread reputation for acuteness. It was not belied. In
less than a year Bipin had secured for his master estates yielding a
net income of nearly Rs. 1,200, which had cost a mere song at auction.
Samarendra Babu never failed to reward him for such bargains. On one
occasion he had such a slice of luck that it is worth while to narrate
it in some detail.</p>
<p>He had just retired to rest for the night, when a servant knocked at
the door to say that Bipin had come on very urgent business. Samarendra
Babu went downstairs to his parlour, clad in a wrapper, to find his
agent pacing up and down in evident agitation. After the usual
compliments had been exchanged, he asked why Bipin had called so
late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have bad news for you, Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;You remember buying the Shibprak&aacute;sh estate at last
auction? Well, that property may slip through your fingers.&rdquo; He
paused to watch the effect of the announcement on his master, and then
went on: &ldquo;The late proprietor has lodged an objection to its
sale, on the ground that no arrears were due, producing a receipt to
substantiate his contention. The Collector has just called on us to
show cause against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1428" href=
"#xd26e1428" name="xd26e1428">93</a>]</span>the cancellation of the
sale and will take the case up the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samarendra was thunderstruck by this information, the
Shibprak&aacute;sh estate being one of the best bargains he had ever
got. After pondering a while, he asked, &ldquo;What would you advise me
to do? I am afraid it is hopeless to contend against a receipt in
full!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bipin was not so easily disheartened. He replied, &ldquo;Let us
consult our pleader, Asu Babu, who is sure to have some plan for
upholding the sale. He won&rsquo;t ask more than Rs. 100, which is not
a tenth of the annual profits for Shibprak&aacute;sh.&rdquo; This
course commended itself to Samarendra, who sent his headman back to
Ghoria, promising to follow next day, with the necessary sinews of war.
He arrived betimes at Bipin&rsquo;s house there, and took him to the
Bar Library, where Asu Babu was sure to be found when not engaged in
Court. A few minutes later the limb of the law came in, and asked what
business brought Samarendra to Ghoria.</p>
<p>After hearing the story of Shibprak&aacute;sh and its vicissitudes
of ownership, he asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will you pay me if I win your case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing at Bipin, Samarendra answered hesitatingly, &ldquo;Well, I
might go as far as fifty rupees&rdquo;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1440" href="#xd26e1440" name="xd26e1440">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take
a pice less than Rs. 100.&rdquo; After several minutes wasted on
haggling, it was agreed that Asu Babu should be paid Rs. 40 on the nail
and Rs. 35 more if he won the suit. The pleader pocketed this first
instalment, and assured Samarendra that he would prove the sale to have
been perfectly valid. Then the trio separated, Samarendra returning to
Bipin&rsquo;s house where they passed the day in forming plans for
further purchases.</p>
<p>At 10.30 on the morrow, both attended at the Collectorate and found
that the Shibprak&aacute;sh objection stood first for hearing. It was
opened by the appellant&rsquo;s pleader, who rose armed with a huge
account book and bundle of receipts, in order to prove that his client
owed nothing to Government, and that the sale proceedings were a
blunder from beginning to end. Asu Babu waited till his turn came, and
then informed the Collector that he would find, on examining his books,
that the appellant was Rs. 1 11. 0. in arrears at the date of the sale.
The Collector ordered his head clerk to produce the ledger account of
payments on account of the Shibprak&aacute;sh estates, and, sure
enough, they showed a short payment of the amount stated. This was a
thunderbolt for the appellant, whose pleader vainly tried to pick holes
in the accounts, but was at last obliged to confess <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1445" href="#xd26e1445" name=
"xd26e1445">95</a>]</span>that a mistake had been made. The only course
open to him was to sue for mercy. The Collector, however, was
inexorable, and indeed he had no power to mitigate the Draconian law of
sale. That of Shibprak&aacute;sh was duly confirmed, and its new owner
adjourned to the bar library to settle matters with his pleader. The
meeting was joyful indeed. After congratulating Asu Babu on his
unexpected success, Samarendra asked how he had managed it. The pleader
at first refused to gratify his curiosity, but yielded to entreaty.
&ldquo;The tiger has a jackal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I, who cannot
stoop to dirty tricks myself, have a certain <i>mukhti&aacute;r</i>
(the lowest grade of advocates) who is hand-in-glove with all the
<i>amlas</i> (clerks) and can twist them round his finger&mdash;for a
consideration. I gave him Rs. 10 out of the advance money and promised
as much more if he could persuade the Collectorate clerks to cook the
appellant&rsquo;s accounts, so as to show a short payment. You see how
well he has succeeded, and now I think the least you can do is to
refund the douceur to me.&rdquo; Samarendra agreed and handed Asu Babu
Rs. 55, prophesying that he would have a brilliant career at the
bar.</p>
<p>He had to stop for a fortnight or so at Ghoria, in order to get
possession of his purchase from the Collectorate <i>n&aacute;zir</i>
(bailiff) who, according to custom, planted a bamboo thereon, as a
symbol of its transfer. While <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1459"
href="#xd26e1459" name="xd26e1459">96</a>]</span>waiting for this
formality he attended another sale for arrears of revenue, in the hope
of picking up some profitable bargains. He was not disappointed. The
last lot was the whole of Jayr&aacute;mpur, a small village quite close
to his house, inhabited by hardworking and submissive ryots, who paid
their rent punctually. Samarendra was all agog when the n&aacute;zir
read out the names of its proprietors, the amount of arrears, and the
boundaries, calling on the crowd to bid. A dead silence followed, which
was at last broken by a timid offer of Rs. 1,000. Samarendra promptly
bid Rs. 6,000; which he knew was hardly three years&rsquo; purchase of
the net rental, and the rise was so tremendous that it choked off all
competition. Jayr&aacute;mpur was knocked down to him; but his
exultation was tempered by the discovery that he had not nearly enough
to meet the amount of earnest money which had to be paid down at once.
A <i>mukhti&aacute;r</i> came to his aid by whispering offers of a
loan, and the requisite amount was forthcoming in five minutes, on
Samarendra&rsquo;s giving his note of hand with a bonus of 10 per cent.
payable next day.</p>
<p>His star continued to be in the eleventh heaven; for this was one of
a series of profitable purchases. In seven or eight years he owned
estates yielding an income of Rs. 8,000, while his dealings in grain
produced half as much again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1466"
href="#xd26e1466" name="xd26e1466">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>Samarendra&rsquo;s ambition rose with growing prosperity. Visions of
a title hovered in his brain, and being a man of resource, he hit upon
an ingenious method of converting them into realities. Close to his
house there was an extensive <i>bil</i> (marsh) peopled in season by
swarms of wild-duck, teal and snipe. It was visited occasionally by
Europeans from Calcutta, who are always on the alert for a day&rsquo;s
sport, but they were inconvenienced by the total lack of accommodation.
So Samarendra built a neat bungalow, equipped it with European
furniture, and placed an old <i>Kh&aacute;ns&aacute;m&aacute;</i>
(Mohammadan butler) in charge, who was versed in all the customs of
<i>S&aacute;heb-log</i> (Englishmen). This menial had orders to report
the arrival of white visitors and offer them hospitality. His courtesy
was highly appreciated, and there was scarcely a Sunday during the cold
weather which did not bring a couple of sportsmen to the bungalow.
Samarendra attended personally to their comforts, thus making many
friends. Through their influence he secured <i>carte blanche</i> in the
matter of guns and ammunition&mdash;a boon which seldom falls to the
lot of middle-class Indians. At their request he subscribed to various
European clubs, winning the reputation of being &ldquo;not half a bad
sort of fellow&rdquo;. All this hospitality, however, was terribly
expensive, and it soon exceeded Samarendra&rsquo;s income. But he went
on spending money <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1481" href=
"#xd26e1481" name="xd26e1481">98</a>]</span>like water, in the
assurance that one day it would yield a golden return.</p>
<p>On a bright morning, in January, 18&mdash;, he was sitting in his
bungalow, in the hope of welcoming guests, when a European entered it,
attended by two orderlies; and seeing a well-dressed Indian, was about
to retire. Samarendra introduced himself as the local Zemindar and
offered to send a <i>shik&aacute;ri</i> (game-keeper) with the visitor
in order to show him some sport. His overtures were gratefully
received, and the European, on returning at noon with a heavy bag, was
delighted to find an appetising tiffin ready for his acceptance.
Samarendra kept out of the way until it was finished, and then asked
whether his guest had enjoyed himself. The latter was profuse in thanks
and, ere leaving for the neighbouring railway station, asked whether he
could be of any service, tendering a card inscribed, &ldquo;Mr. Charles
Bernardson, Indian Civil Service&rdquo;. He was none other than the
Chief Secretary to Government.</p>
<p>Such an acquaintance was not to be lost sight of. A week later
Samarendra went to Calcutta and called on Mr. Bernardson at his
chambers in the United Service Club. He was received, so to speak, with
open arms, questioned about crops, crime, sport, and other commonplace
topics, and again assured that Mr. Bernardson would serve him in any
way within his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1490" href=
"#xd26e1490" name="xd26e1490">99</a>]</span>power. The latter hint was
promptly taken. On receiving permission to quit the great man&rsquo;s
presence he timidly suggested that he would like to be an Honorary
Magistrate. Mr. Bernardson took note of the wish, and a few weeks later
the <i>Gazette</i> announced Samarendra&rsquo;s nomination to the
Ghoria Independent Bench, with power to try cases singly.</p>
<p>The next point was to attract the attention of the district
authorities. Samarendra pored over the Penal and Procedure Codes, took
lessons in law from Asu Babu, and soon mastered the routine of a petty
Court of Justice. He never missed any sitting of the Bench and
signalised himself by a rigorous interpretation of the law. Offenders
had short shrift from him; and the police moved heaven and earth to get
their cases disposed of in his Court. His percentage of convictions was
larger than that of any honorary magistrate. Such zeal deserved a
suitable reward, and it soon attracted the attention of the
authorities. On New Year&rsquo;s Day, 189&ndash;, the <i>Calcutta
Gazette</i> came out with its usual list of honours, amongst which was
seen a R&aacute;i Bah&aacute;durship for Samarendra. This dignity
answers to the English knighthood, and it is usually made an excuse for
rejoicings shared by all classes. Samarendra, however, thought it
unnecessary to waste money on junketings. He preferred subscribing to
movements favoured by the &ldquo;little tin gods&rdquo; of Darjiling.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1500" href="#xd26e1500" name=
"xd26e1500">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>Towards the end of the same year, he was accosted, while leaving
Court one afternoon, by a <i>chupr&aacute;ssi</i> (orderly) attached to
the magistrate-collector&rsquo;s person, who sal&aacute;med
obsequiously and said that the <i>Bara Saheb</i> wished to see him at
once. Hastening to the district chief&rsquo;s bungalow he was
graciously received, and in the course of conversation a remark fell
from the great man&rsquo;s lips, which made the blood course wildly
through his veins. It seemed that a fund had been started in Calcutta
for the purpose of erecting some permanent memorial to the late
Viceroy, and a hint was thrown out that if Samarendra subscribed
liberally, he might possibly find himself gazetted a
&ldquo;R&aacute;j&aacute; Bah&aacute;dur&rdquo;. He assured the
magistrate that the Memorial Fund would receive a handsome donation
from him and asked for a few days in order to decide the amount.</p>
<p>On returning home, he made a rough calculation of his assets and
liabilities. The latter amounted to nearly a lakh of rupees
(&pound;6,666), or about five times his net annual income. Common
prudence suggested that he ought not to increase the burden; but
ambition prevailed, and the only question which Samarendra set himself
was, &ldquo;What is the least amount I can decently give?&rdquo; After
thinking over pros and cons for a whole night, he decided that Rs.
10,000 would be enough; raised that sum at 12 per cent, by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1511" href="#xd26e1511" name=
"xd26e1511">101</a>]</span>mortgaging some landed property, and sent it
with a flowery letter to the District Magistrate, as a humble donation
to the Viceroy&rsquo;s Memorial Eund.</p>
<p>A few days later Samarendra was preparing for a visit to his
favourite rest-house, in the vague hope that Mr. Bernardson might turn
up again, when a strange Brahman entered the courtyard and thus
addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you are an Amir, and I am a beggar. I have a request to
make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it short,&rdquo; replied Samarendra testily. &ldquo;Come
to the point&mdash;what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have a grown-up daughter who positively must be
married; but I cannot raise a sufficient dowry. Will your honour give
me a trifle towards making one up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t; if you belonged to this village you would
know that I cannot afford to fling money about. My expenses are
enormous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, please, don&rsquo;t refuse me, R&aacute;i
Bah&aacute;dur; surely you can spare a couple of rupees to a poor
Brahman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samarendra was exasperated by the man&rsquo;s importunity. He
replied sharply, &ldquo;You and your kind seem to think that I am
<i>Kuver</i> (the God of Wealth) incarnate, who is able to satisfy
every human need! I won&rsquo;t give you anything!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1531" href="#xd26e1531" name=
"xd26e1531">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one rupee, R&aacute;i Bah&aacute;dur,&rdquo; pleaded the
Brahman with folded hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! Get out of my house at once!&rdquo; bellowed
Samarendra; then turning to his doorkeeper, he ordered him to
&ldquo;run the fellow out of the yard by the neck&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Brahman was deeply incensed. Drawing himself up to his full
height, he looked scornfully at Samarendra, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babu, you dare to order me, a Brahman, to be ejected with
violence from your house. Is there no religion left in this world? Mark
my words, a day is coming when you will be poorer even than myself. I
have spoken.&rdquo; Then he strode out of the courtyard in high
dudgeon. Samarendra merely laughed aloud and hurled mocking epithets
after his retreating figure, to which no reply was vouchsafed.</p>
<p>Next morning he received a letter from the District Magistrate which
filled him with mingled joy and terror. It contained a curt request to
call at once on a matter of great importance. He drove to the great
man&rsquo;s bungalow arrayed in his best, but was kept waiting for
nearly a quarter of an hour in the porch. When he was ushered into the
magistrate&rsquo;s study he saw intuitively that something was wrong.
His sal&aacute;m was returned by a mere inclination of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1542" href="#xd26e1542" name=
"xd26e1542">102</a>]</span>the head and a request to be seated. Then
the Magistrate spoke in tones of chilling politeness:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;R&aacute;i Bah&aacute;dur, I&rsquo;ve sent for you to say
that a subscription of Rs. 10,000 is wholly unworthy of your position.
If you wish, I will send it to the Secretary of the Memorial Fund; but
I warn you plainly that the most you can expect in return is an
expression of the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s thanks in the
<i>Gazette</i>. I could not possibly recommend you for a title for such
a paltry sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Samarendra&rsquo;s heart beat more loudly than the clock on the
magistrate&rsquo;s mantelpiece. He stammered out: &ldquo;I need only
assure your honour that I have given as much as I could afford; but if
your honour thinks the amount
insufficient&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;I am quite willing to
give&mdash;twice as much&rdquo;. So saying he awaited a reply in
trembling apprehension. It was satisfactory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, R&aacute;i Bah&aacute;dur, you are talking sense. Send
me Rs. 10,000 more for the fund and I&rsquo;ll undertake to submit your
name to Government for a R&aacute;j&aacute;ship. It will be just in
time for the New Year&rsquo;s <i>Gazette</i>. Now you may take
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samarendra bowed himself out with precipitation and, on returning
home, sent for his factotum, Bipin, to whom he related this momentous
interview, with an injunction to raise Rs. 10,000 more by hook or by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1559" href="#xd26e1559" name=
"xd26e1559">104</a>]</span>crook. Bipin shook his head ominously and
feared that no moneylender would advance any considerable sum on
estates already over-burdened. However, he promised to do his best and
negotiated so successfully that Rs. 10,000 were procured at 24 per
cent. in less than a week. This additional subscription was gracefully
acknowledged by the District Magistrate, and a fortnight later
Samarendra&rsquo;s drooping spirits were revived by the appearance of a
notification in the <i>Gazette</i> thanking him warmly for his
&ldquo;munificence and public spirit&rdquo;. There was nothing for it
but to count the days of the expiring year.</p>
<p>On 31st December, 189-, his impatience could brook no further delay.
Hurrying to Calcutta by train, he sent a trusty servant to the
Government printing office with orders to obtain the earliest copy of
the <i>Gazette</i> at any price. He slept not a wink on that fateful
night and rose betimes to intercept the messenger.</p>
<p>At last the bulky document was thrust into his hands. He unfolded it
with trembling fingers and glanced downwards through an interminable
list of newly-made M&aacute;h&aacute;r&aacute;jas, Naw&aacute;b
Bah&aacute;durs, R&aacute;j&aacute; Bah&aacute;durs, and
R&aacute;j&aacute;s&mdash;in the hope of finding his own name. Alas, it
was conspicuous by its absence. Oh, the pangs of hope deferred and
wounded pride! Death seemed to Samarendra preferable to a life of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1571" href="#xd26e1571" name=
"xd26e1571">105</a>]</span>poverty and despair. He returned home
crestfallen and nursed his disappointment until it landed him in a
severe attack of brain fever. As soon as he felt strong enough to leave
the house, he drove to the magistrate&rsquo;s house for explanation and
comfort. He was courteously received, but the Chief hinted that there
might be a hitch about the title, as he himself had enemies in the
Secretariat, who would be glad of an opportunity of placing him in a
false position. He counselled patience and expressed a conviction that
the birthday <i>Gazette</i> would contain the notification so ardently
desired.</p>
<p>This was comforting, but Samarendra resolved to push his own
interests. He remembered the promises made by Mr. Bernardson and took
the next train to Calcutta in order to secure his influence. On
reaching the Secretariat he learnt, with deep annoyance, that Mr.
Bernardson had taken sick leave to England and was not likely to
return. So the only course open was to wait for 24th May. Again he was
disappointed, the list of birthday honours ignoring him completely.
Samarendra had not even the resource of consulting the official who had
lured him into extravagant expenditure. The District Magistrate was
transferred to a distant and unhealthy part of the province, and his
successor disclaimed all knowledge of the bargain. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1578" href="#xd26e1578" name=
"xd26e1578">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>Samarendra&rsquo;s long suspense and repeated disappointments told
severely on his health. He neglected business, leaving everything in
the hands of Bipin, who was more anxious to feather his own nest than
extricate his master from difficulties; so the interest in mortgages
fell into arrears. One creditor bolder than the rest sued him and
foreclosed; then others were encouraged to attack the ruined man. In
less than a year, Samarendra was stripped of every <i>bigha</i>
(one-third of an acre) of land he once possessed, and attachments
galore were issued against his moveable property. Too late did he see
the depths of folly into which he had fallen.</p>
<p>Grief and despair brought on a second attack of brain fever, which
exhausted his failing strength. After tossing for several weeks in
delirium he regained sense only to feel assured that the end of all
worldly ambition was fast approaching. Then he remembered the
Brahman&rsquo;s curse, and knowing that it was the cause of all his
misfortunes he endeavoured to make some reparation; but the holy man
was not to be found. One evening he fell into a deep slumber from which
he never awoke, leaving a wife and several helpless children in
comparative penury. Then a hush fell on the land, and people whispered
that <i>Brahmateja</i> (the power of Brahmans) was by no means extinct.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nagendra&rsquo;s soul was not haunted by any such
ambitions. He was content with the surplus profits from his landed
estates, which he did not invest in trade or even Government paper, but
hoarded in a safe. By slow degrees he amassed a small fortune, and when
Samarendra&rsquo;s growing impecuniosity forced him to ask his brother
for a loan of Rs. 2,000, it was readily granted on a mere note of hand.
In less than six months the borrower died and, after waiting as long,
Nagendra pressed his sister-in-law for payment of the debt. She
referred him to her brother, Priyanath Guha, who, she said, was manager
of what property she had left. This man was a scoundrel of the deepest
dye, and Samarendra, who was fully aware of the fact, never allowed him
inside the house. After his death Priya made himself so useful to the
widow that she invited him to live in her house and trusted him
implicitly. When the neighbours learnt this arrangement they whispered
that the poor woman would inevitably be reduced to beggary.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1595" href="#xd26e1595" name=
"xd26e1595">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nagendra reluctantly applied to Priya for a refund of the loan,
producing Samarendra&rsquo;s note of hand, which was about a year
overdue. After examining it, Priya said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is simple enough. My sister must repay you; but
you know the muddle in which her husband&rsquo;s affairs were left, and
I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t refuse to renew the bond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra replied that he would gladly give his sister any reasonable
time to discharge her debt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; rejoined Priya. &ldquo;What do you say to
my renewing this note of hand for six months, with 12 per cent.
interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no objection,&rdquo; said Nagendra, &ldquo;but you
must satisfy me first that you hold a general power of attorney to act
for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you doubt my word,&rdquo; sneered Priya, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t blame you; such is the way of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he took a registered power of attorney out of his
sister&rsquo;s strong box, which Nagendra saw entitled him to transact
any business whatever relating to her estate. He handed the bond to
Priya and asked him to endorse the conditions agreed on. While doing so
Priya looked up. &ldquo;Have you any objection,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;to my antedating the renewal a week or so. The fact is, Baisakh
12th has always <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1610" href=
"#xd26e1610" name="xd26e1610">109</a>]</span>been a lucky day in my
family and I should like to date my endorsement then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you like,&rdquo; answered Nagendra indifferently; and
after reading the endorsement through very carefully he took the note
of hand away without saluting Priya.</p>
<p>Not hearing from him when the note matured, Nagendra called at his
sister&rsquo;s house and pressed Priya, whom he found there, for
payment of the Rs. 2,000 and interest.</p>
<p>Priya gazed at him with feigned astonishment &ldquo;What loan are
you talking about?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Nagendra attempted to jog his memory, but he stoutly denied having
renewed any note of hand which purported to have been executed by
Samarendra. When the document was shown him, he boldly declared that
the endorsement was a forgery, and further that the handwriting on the
note of hand itself was not Samarendra&rsquo;s. Nagendra stood aghast
for awhile and, on regaining his wits, he said, &ldquo;I ought to have
known better than trust a <i>haramz&aacute;d&aacute;</i> like
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t descend to personalities,&rdquo; rejoined
Priya. &ldquo;I can prove that the endorsement could not have been
executed by me; and the whole transaction looks fishy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for Nagendra, who lost his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1628" href="#xd26e1628" name=
"xd26e1628">110</a>]</span>temper and abused the scoundrel roundly.
They separated with threats of mutual vengeance.</p>
<p>On the morrow, Nagendra instructed a pleader to file a suit against
his sister for recovery of the principal and interest due on the
promissory note. When it came on for hearing before the Subordinate
Judge, Nagendra Babu was dumbfoundered by hearing the defendant&rsquo;s
pleader aver that the endorsement could not possibly be genuine,
inasmuch as his client was fifteen hundred miles from Ratnapur at the
alleged date of execution. He then placed Priya in the box, to swear
that, on Baisakh 12th, he was at Lahore, in order to give evidence in a
civil suit. All doubt vanished in the Sub Judge&rsquo;s mind when the
pleader handed him a document bearing the seal of the Chief Court of
the Punjab, certifying that Priya had been in attendance on that day.
He dismissed the suit with costs against Nagendra, and remarked that
this palpable forgery cast discredit on the whole transaction.</p>
<p>It was a wise man who said that we hate our enemies less for the
harm they have done us than for the harm we have done them. Priya was
not content with depriving Nagendra of his dues; he resolved to injure
him more materially. About a month after his unlucky lawsuit, Nagendra
learnt quite by accident that one of his estates named Lakhimpur had
been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1634" href="#xd26e1634" name=
"xd26e1634">111</a>]</span>notified for sale for arrears of land
revenue amounting to Rs. 197 odd. The Naib (manager), on being asked to
account for this, laid all the blame on the ryots, who, he said, would
not be made to pay their rent and thus deprived him of the means of
satisfying the Government demand. Nagendra rebuked him for gross
negligence and failing to report the matter, for, he added, the arrears
would have been paid from his own pocket. He at once dismissed the Naib
from his employ and hastened to Ghoria, where he instructed a pleader
named Asu Babu to petition the collector for leave to make good the
arrears on Lakhimpur. The request was perforce rejected. Lakhimpur was
put up for sale and Nagendra ascertained that the purchaser was a man
of straw representing Priya himself. He endured the loss of a valuable
property, resolving to be even some day with his enemy.</p>
<p>On the following night he was about to retire to bed, when the
Lakhimpur Naib burst into the parlour and clasped his master&rsquo;s
feet which he bedewed with tears. Nagendra shook him off roughly and
asked how he dared to intrude upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; whined the Naib, &ldquo;I want to make
a clean breast of my misdeeds. It was Priya who persuaded me to
withhold the revenue due on Lakhimpur, by promising me a reward of Rs.
2,000 if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1640" href="#xd26e1640"
name="xd26e1640">112</a>]</span>the estate was auctioned. Now that he
has got possession of it, he refuses to carry out his bargain and
actually offers me Rs. 20, saying that I deserved no more. The
black-hearted villain! Now I am come to implore forgiveness of my sin
and to make amends for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra was amazed by the fellow&rsquo;s villainy and impudence. He
reflected, however, that nothing was to be gained by kicking him out of
the house, while his offer of reparation was not to be despised. He
replied, &ldquo;You have been faithless to your salt; but I will pardon
you on one condition that you help me to regain my estate, lost through
your treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; protested the Naib. &ldquo;Only let me
have Rs. 300 in currency notes of one hundred rupees each, previously
recording the numbers. I swear by Mother K&aacute;li, not only to pay
the arrears of revenue but to get the sale quashed.&rdquo; Nagendra at
first thought that to do so would be only throwing good money after
bad; but the man was terribly in earnest, and evidently hostile to
their common enemy. He opened his safe and handed the Naib the amount
he asked, after carefully taking the numbers of the notes.</p>
<p>At the same hour on the morrow, the Naib returned in high glee to
say that the business had been satisfactorily concluded. All Nagendra
had to do was to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1648" href=
"#xd26e1648" name="xd26e1648">113</a>]</span>file a petition praying
for the cancellation of the sale, and it could not fail to be granted.
On being asked how he had contrived to evade the law, the Naib went
on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you the whole truth, Mah&aacute;say, only
concealing names; for the people, who helped me extracted an oath that
I would keep them a profound secret. I went straight from your house
last night to that of an office tout, who is a precious rascal, but
tolerated because he is in some way related to the Collectorate head
clerk. On hearing my story he said he thought the matter could be
settled, and asked me to meet him at 1 P.M. under a Nim tree north of
the Collectorate, when he would bring a man to me who was able to do
all we wished. I was punctual to the minute, and sure enough the tout
came with one of the Collectorate clerks. I asked him whether it would
not be possible so to manipulate the accounts of Lakhimpur, as to show
that all Government revenue had been paid prior to the alleged default.
The clerk at first refused to have hand in such a transaction, as it
would be too risky; but when I produced my currency notes he thought
the job might be attempted, and added that some of the Treasury
<i>amlas</i> (clerks) would have to be squared as well as himself. I
thereupon handed him Rs. 300, saying that it was enough to discharge
the revenue due on Lakhimpur and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1656" href="#xd26e1656" name="xd26e1656">114</a>]</span>leave
more than Rs. 100 to divide as <i>bakshish</i> (gratuity). He said that
he would do his best and made me swear never to divulge his name. We
then separated, and only two hours ago the tout came to my house with
the news that the accounts had been corrected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nagendra was delighted on hearing these clever tactics and
straightway ordered his pleader, Asutosh Sen, widely known as Asu Babu,
to file a petition praying for the cancellation of the sale. It came in
due course before the Collector for hearing. He called for the
accounts, which fully substantiated the petitioner&rsquo;s statements.
After hearing the arguments of Priya&rsquo;s representative the
Collector said that he was fully satisfied that a mistake had been
made, and called on the head clerk to explain the non-entry of a
payment made before the due date. That officer laid the whole blame on
an unfortunate apprentice, who was promptly dismissed. The sale was
declared null and void, and Nagendra regained his own to the intense
disgust of the rascally Priya. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1663"

<p class="first">Nagendra Babu was now the wealthiest man in Ratnapur.
Puffed up by worldly success, he began to treat his neighbours
arrogantly and, with one exception, they did not dare to pay him back
in his own coin. R&aacute;md&aacute;s Ghosal, known far and wide as
R&aacute;md&aacute;, flattered or feared no one. Having a little
rent-free and inherited land, he was quite independent of patronage.
R&aacute;md&aacute; was &ldquo;everyone&rsquo;s grandfather,&rdquo; a
friend of the poor, whose joys and sorrows he shared. He watched by
sick-beds, helped to carry dead bodies to the burning-gh&aacute;t, in
short did everything in his power for others, refusing remuneration in
any shape. He was consequently loved and respected by all classes.
R&aacute;md&aacute; was the consistent enemy of hypocrisy and
oppression&mdash;qualities which became conspicuous in Nagendra
Babu&rsquo;s nature under the deteriorating influence of wealth. He met
the great man&rsquo;s studied insolence with a volley of chaff, which
is particularly galling to vain people because they are incapable of
understanding it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1669" href=
"#xd26e1669" name="xd26e1669">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nagendra Babu did not forget the Brahman&rsquo;s presumption and
determined to teach him a lesson. So, one day, he sent him a written
notice demanding the immediate payment of arrears of rent due for a few
<i>bighas</i> (one-third of an acre) of land which R&aacute;md&aacute;
held on a heritable lease. As luck would have it the crops had failed
miserably, and R&aacute;md&aacute; was unable to discharge his debts.
On receiving a more peremptory demand seven days later, he called on
Nagendra Babu, whom he thus addressed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nagen, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? You are
plaguing me to death with notices, yet you must be aware that I
can&rsquo;t pay you a pice at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&aacute;kur,&rdquo; replied Nagendra Babu in stern accents,
&ldquo;I will listen to none of your excuses. Do you mean to tell me
that you decline to discharge your arrears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; protested R&aacute;md&aacute;;
&ldquo;but you must really wait till the beginning of next year. My
cold weather crops are looking well; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do at all. If you do not pay up in a
week, I will certainly have recourse to the civil court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so by all means if your sense of religion permits,&rdquo;
rejoined R&aacute;md&aacute;, leaving the parlour in smothered
wrath.</p>
<p>When the week of grace had expired, Nagendra Babu filed a suit in
the local M&uacute;nsiffs Court against <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1687" href="#xd26e1687" name="xd26e1687">117</a>]</span>his
defaulter. As soon as the fact was bruited abroad a universal protest
was roused against Nagendra Babu&rsquo;s harshness. Some of the village
elders remonstrated with him, but were told to mind their own business;
whereon they laid their heads together and subscribed the small sum due
from the Brahman. A deputation of five waited on him with entreaties to
accept it, but he refused to take the money on any other footing than a
loan. So R&aacute;md&aacute; paid his arrears and costs into Court, to
the plaintiff&rsquo;s intense annoyance.</p>
<p>Samarendra Babu had left his wife and children in comparatively poor
circumstances; for, after discharging his debts, they had barely Rs.
300 a year to live on. The widow declined to seek Nagendra Babu&rsquo;s
help, even if she were reduced to beg in the streets. After her
brother&rsquo;s imprisonment, she had no one to manage her little
property which, as a Purdanashin (lit. &ldquo;one sitting behind the
veil&rdquo;), she was unable to do herself. After mature reflection she
sent for R&aacute;md&aacute;, who had known her from infancy. He obeyed
the summons with alacrity and gave the poor woman sound advice
regarding the direction of the Zemindary. By acting on it she was able
to increase her income and live in tolerable comfort. Observing that
R&aacute;md&aacute; was a frequent visitor, Nagendra Babu hinted to his
sister-in-law that, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1691" href=
"#xd26e1691" name="xd26e1691">118</a>]</span>she cared for her
reputation, she would not be so thick with him. She flared up
instantly. &ldquo;I will talk to any of my friends I please,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;and you shan&rsquo;t poke your nose into my
affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Nagendra angrily, &ldquo;but you
may rely on my making it hot for that old scoundrel shortly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This threat was of course repeated to R&aacute;md&aacute;, who
merely laughed. As far as he was concerned Nagendra might act as he
pleased.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards the bailiff of Nagendra Babu&rsquo;s estate,
known as Lakhimpur, called on R&aacute;md&aacute; with a verbal request
that he should surrender his ancestral tenure and, meeting with a curt
refusal, left the house threatening all sorts of evil consequences.
Next day, indeed, R&aacute;md&aacute; received a notice from Nagendra
Babu, calling on him to show cause against the cancellation of his
lease on the ground that, by mismanaging the land, he had rendered it
unfit for cultivation. R&aacute;md&aacute; called some of his
neighbours together, to whom he exhibited the document. They expressed
the greatest indignation and assured him that they would spend their
last rupee in defending his interests. R&aacute;md&aacute; gave them a
heartfelt blessing and promised a divine reward for their sympathy.</p>
<p>Calling on Samarendra&rsquo;s widow the same day, he was distressed
to find that she had received a similar <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1702" href="#xd26e1702" name="xd26e1702">119</a>]</span>notice,
which aimed at robbing her of a small estate, on the ground that it had
been surrendered by her husband in part payment of his debt to Nagendra
Babu. She knew nothing of any such arrangement and assured
R&aacute;md&aacute; that, if the property was lost, her income would
fall to little more than Rs. 100, meaning starvation for herself and
little ones. Her trusty counsellor told her not to lose heart, for she
might rely on his help.</p>
<p>In due course the suit against R&aacute;md&aacute; came on for
hearing before the Munsiff. His pleader established by documentary
evidence that the tenure was one without any condition whatever; while
the neighbours came forward to prove that the land in dispute had been
admirably tilled. The plaintiff, therefore, was non-suited, with costs.
The very same result attended Nagendra Babu&rsquo;s action against his
sister-in-law, whose case excited universal sympathy. He lost heavily
in purse and left the Court with a ruined reputation. It was natural
that a man so evil-minded should regard R&aacute;md&aacute; as the
author of misfortunes due to his own wicked nature. He plotted the poor
Brahman&rsquo;s destruction, but no effectual means of compassing it
suggested itself.</p>
<p>As days and weeks wore on, his despondency became deeper and, one
evening, while sitting with the Lakhimpur bailiff, he asked whether
there was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1708" href="#xd26e1708"
name="xd26e1708">120</a>]</span>any remedy which would restore his
peace of mind. The cunning rascal said nothing at the time; but at a
late hour on the morrow he came to Nagendra Babu&rsquo;s house with a
large bottle hidden under his wrapper. It contained some light brown
fluid, which the bailiff poured into a tumbler. Then adding a small
quantity of water, he invited his master to swallow the mixture. A few
minutes after doing so, the patient was delighted to find that gloomy
thoughts disappeared as if by magic. An unwonted elation of spirits
succeeded; he broke into snatches of song, to the intense surprise of
the household! His amateur physician left the bottle, advising him to
take a similar dose every night; and Nagendra Babu followed the
prescription punctiliously, with the best effect on his views of life.
After finishing the bottle he asked for another, which was brought to
him secretly. It had a showy label reading, &ldquo;Exshaw No. 1
Cognac&rdquo;. Nagendra Babu&rsquo;s conscience accused him of
disobeying the Sh&aacute;stras; but the die was cast. He could no
longer exist without a daily dose of the subtle poison; and gradually
increased it to a tumblerful, forgetting to add water.</p>
<p>His faithful wife did her best to wean him from the fatal habit. She
even ventured to abstract his brandy bottle and dilute its contents. On
being detected, she underwent a personal correction which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1712" href="#xd26e1712" name=
"xd26e1712">121</a>]</span>was not soon forgotten. The poor creature,
indeed, underwent every sort of humiliation from her worthless husband,
which she bore in silence, hoping that time would bring him to his
senses.</p>
<p>Drunken men are proverbially cunning. After brooding long over his
supposed grievances Nagendra matured a scheme of revenge. He
intercepted R&aacute;md&aacute;, one afternoon, on his way to visit
Samarendra&rsquo;s widow, and, affecting sincere penitence for the
injury he had endeavoured to work, he invited the unsuspecting Brahman
into his sitting-room. Once inside, he suddenly thrust a brass vessel
into his visitor&rsquo;s hand and dragged him into the yard, shouting
&ldquo;Thief! thief!&rdquo; The Lakhimpur bailiff, who was sitting on
the verandah, also laid hands on R&aacute;md&aacute; and, with the aid
of two up-country servants, he was dragged to the police station, too
bewildered to resist. On their way thither they met one of
Nagendra&rsquo;s neighbours named Harish Chandra P&aacute;l, who
stopped them and asked what was the matter. On learning particulars of
the charge, he saw how the land lay, and resolved to defeat an infamous
plot. So waiting till the little crowd was out of sight, he ran back to
Nagendra&rsquo;s house and whispered to him that the bailiff had sent
for more property, in order that the case against R&aacute;md&aacute;
might look blacker. Nagendra handed him a fine muslin shawl and
loin-cloth, and a set of gold buttons, adding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1716" href="#xd26e1716" name=
"xd26e1716">122</a>]</span>that he would follow in half an hour in
order to depose against the thief. On reaching the police station,
Harish found the Sub-Inspector recording the statements of the
witnesses. He looked on in silence until Nagendra arrived. Then he
asked the Sub-Inspector: &ldquo;Do these people mean to say that the
brass vessel belongs to Nagendra Babu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Here are three
witnesses who have identified it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Harish; then
producing the shawl and loin-cloth he said: &ldquo;These are mine, but
if you ask Nagen Babu he will tell you a different story&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are mine!&rdquo; roared Nagendra, &ldquo;and part of
the stolen property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Harish, &ldquo;perhaps you will say that
these buttons are yours too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sub-Inspector Babu,&rdquo; said Harish, &ldquo;you must
see that Nagendra Babu is subject to strange hallucinations since he
has taken to drink. He fancies that he is the god of wealth
personified, and that everything belongs to him. I am quite certain
that R&aacute;md&aacute; has been falsely charged with stealing a brass
vessel which is his own property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sub-Inspector evidently thought so too. He called the prosecutor
into an inner room. What passed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1733" href="#xd26e1733" name="xd26e1733">123</a>]</span>between
them there was never known; but presently the Sub-Inspector returned to
the office and ordered the prisoner to be at once released.
R&aacute;md&aacute; was truly grateful to Harish P&aacute;l for having
so cleverly saved him from ruin, and the whole story soon became common
property. Nagendra overheard his neighbours whispering and pointing to
him significantly, and village boys called him ill-natured nicknames in
the street. His irritation was increased by recourse to the brandy
bottle, and he vented it on his luckless wife. She suffered so terribly
that, one morning, Nagendra found her hanging from a rafter in his
cowshed. This suicide was the last straw. Nagendra saved himself from
prosecution for murder by a heavy bribe, and got leave from the police
to burn his wife&rsquo;s body. But so universally was he execrated that
not a man in the village would help him to take her body to the
burning-gh&aacute;t. In dire despair he humbled himself so far as to
implore R&aacute;md&aacute;&rsquo;s assistance. The magnanimous Brahman
forgot his wrongs and cheerfully consented to bear a hand. Others
followed his example, and thus Nagendra was able to fulfil the rites
prescribed by religion. The lesson was not altogether lost on him. The
scales fell from his eyes; he dismissed the rascally servant, who had
led him from the path of duty, and foreswore his brandy bottle.

<h2 class="main">A Rift in the Lute.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nalini Chandra Basu worked hard for the B.L. degree,
not to fill his pockets by juggling with other people&rsquo;s
interests, but in order to help the poor, who are so often victims of
moneyed oppression. After securing the coveted distinction, he was
enrolled as a pleader of the Calcutta High Court and began to practise
there, making it a rule to accept no fees from an impoverished client.
But two years of constant attendance at Court convinced Nalini that
Calcutta had far too many lawyers already. He therefore removed to
Ghoria, knowing that he would find plenty of wrongs to redress there.
About a month after his arrival, a Zemindar of Kadampur, named Debendra
Chandra Mitra, sued one of his ryots for ejectment in the local
M&uacute;nsiff&rsquo;s Court. Nalini espoused the defendant&rsquo;s
cause and showed so stout a fight that the case was dismissed with
costs. Debendra Babu was deeply offended with the young pleader, and
determined to do him a bad turn if possible.</p>
<p>About a week later Nalini got a telegram from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1744" href="#xd26e1744" name=
"xd26e1744">125</a>]</span>Benares announcing his mother&rsquo;s death.
He promptly donned the customary K&aacute;cha (mourning-cloth) and
hurried home, only to find his brother, Jadun&aacute;th Babu, already
in possession of the sad news; and they went to Benares to comfort
their stricken father.</p>
<p>After the customary month of mourning Jadu Babu made preparations
for celebrating the <i>sr&aacute;dh</i> on a grand scale, by giving
presents to distinguished Brahmans, feasting his relatives, and
distributing alms to the poor. No money was spared in order to keep his
mother&rsquo;s memory green. The family&rsquo;s position would have
been most enviable, but for a slight unpleasantness which was created
by some of the villagers. Debendra Babu, who had been waiting for an
opportunity of revenge, went from house to house urging his neighbours
not to participate in the sr&aacute;dh, on the score that Nalini had
married into a strange clan and was <i>ipso facto</i> an outcast. Jadu
Babu was stung to the quick on learning these machinations. He
consulted Nalini as to the best method of parrying them, and was
consoled by his brother&rsquo;s assurance that it would be quite easy
to win over his opponents except, perhaps, Debendra Babu himself.</p>
<p>When the time for distributing Sam&aacute;jik (gifts) came round,
Jadu Babu sent one to every caste-fellow <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1756" href="#xd26e1756" name="xd26e1756">126</a>]</span>in the
village, but all returned them without a word of explanation. Nalini
was not so much distressed as he by the rebuff. He advised an attempt
to pacify Debendra Babu; which failing, he would put his scheme into
execution. The two brothers, therefore, called on their enemy, and
falling at his feet, implored him to say how they had offended him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are much better off than I am,&rdquo; replied Debendra
Babu sarcastically; &ldquo;it would be presumptuous for me to consort
with such people. You remember the old fable of the earthen pot and
brass vessel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; pleaded Jadu Babu, &ldquo;we are young
enough to be your sons. If we have unwittingly caused you offence, we
beg to be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have learnt how to talk sweetly enough,&rdquo; rejoined
Debendra Babu. &ldquo;Nalini fancies himself a <i>L&aacute;t</i> (lord)
or <i>b&aacute;dsh&aacute;h</i> at the very least. What times we live
in! The young have no respect whatever for their seniors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nalini is hardly more than a boy,&rdquo; said Jadu Babu with
folded hands. &ldquo;I am sure he had not the slightest intention of
hurting your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of talking nonsense?&rdquo; growled
Debendra Babu. &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; and he pointed to the door.</p>
<p>The brothers did not stir; but Jadu Babu asked, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1776" href="#xd26e1776" name=
"xd26e1776">127</a>]</span>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t overlook our
faults, or even tell us what they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you will have it,&rdquo; replied Debendra Babu in
measured accents, &ldquo;Nalini is an outcast; and no respectable
Kayastha can take part in your mother&rsquo;s
<i>sr&aacute;dh</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jadu Babu fairly lost his temper. He exclaimed: &ldquo;If there is a
flaw in my sister-in-law&rsquo;s pedigree, what is to be said of people
who visit women of alien religions, take food from their hands, and
tipple strong liquor with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a home thrust. Debendra Babu was well-known to be carrying
on an intrigue with a Mohammadan woman, named Ser&aacute;ji, but as he
was well-to-do, no one had dared to propose his excommunication. He
started from his feet in an outburst of fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you have the audacity to lecture me&mdash;a wretched
brat like you? Leave my house at once.&rdquo; So saying he flounced
into his inner apartments; while the brothers went away rather
crestfallen.</p>
<p>After returning home Nalini disclosed his famous scheme for
circumventing the boycott, which Jadu Babu heartily approved. To every
Sam&aacute;jik they added an envelope containing a new ten-rupee note
and sent them round to their caste-fellows. The sight of money banished
prejudices; one and all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1792" href=
"#xd26e1792" name="xd26e1792">128</a>]</span>received the gifts, and
some were so shameless as to hint that similar largesse would be
acceptable to their uncles or cousins.</p>
<p>Debendra Babu was deeply annoyed by the success of the strategy. He
swore a mighty oath not to rest until he had destroyed the Basu family
root and branch. After a good deal of thought he matured a plan which
was to be executed through a notorious widow belonging to the village.
This creature, Hiramani by name, had passed middle life and lived on a
little money left by her husband, in a hut close to Debendra&rsquo;s
residence. People used to say that God had created her a female by
oversight, for she had every bad quality which a man could possess. She
was noted for the fact that misfortune invariably fell on a house which
she honoured with her intimacy. People were very shy indeed of inviting
her.</p>
<p>One bright afternoon Hiramani called at the Basus and started a
conversation with the wives of Jadu and Nalini by inquiring about their
household affairs, and offering advice which is generally acceptable if
seldom acted on. While they sat talking Jadu Babu&rsquo;s eldest boy
came to his mother, whimpering:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chota K&aacute;k&aacute;</i> (my young uncle) has whipped
me because an inkpot of his slipped from my hand, while I was playing
with it, and got broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He served you rightly, naughty boy!&rdquo; observed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1805" href="#xd26e1805" name=
"xd26e1805">129</a>]</span>his mother administering a sharp slap which
sent the child off bellowing loudly.</p>
<p>Hiramani remarked, &ldquo;You ought not to beat him for so trivial a
fault&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a terrible boy,&rdquo; explained the mother.
&ldquo;He is up to all manner of tricks, and if he is not checked, he
will grow up a regular <i>Badm&aacute;sh</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; remarked Hiramani; &ldquo;but has he not
been too cruelly used by his uncle? You must have noticed the welts on
his naked back. I counted five as broad as my forefinger. How could a
grown-up man torture a child like that?&rdquo;&mdash;and she looked
meaningly at her hostess.</p>
<p>The mother was evidently impressed by these words. She undertook to
speak to Nalini about his treatment of her son. Hiramani was delighted
to see that the poison was beginning to work. She went straight from
the Basus&rsquo; house to Debendra Babu and reported her success. He
praised her warmly, presented her with a rupee, and offered further
instructions.</p>
<p>Hiramani soon became a regular visitor of the Basu ladies. She lost
no opportunity of poisoning the mind of Jadu Babu&rsquo;s wife, by
retailing Nalini&rsquo;s iniquities. At the outset her insinuations
were disregarded; but in time the elder wife fell so completely under
Hiramani&rsquo;s influence as to accept her stories as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1821" href="#xd26e1821" name=
"xd26e1821">130</a>]</span>gospel truth. One day, indeed, she ventured
to ask her husband to separate from his brother and, on meeting with a
peremptory refusal, declared that she would take no food while Nalini
remained in the house. Ending that she really meant to carry out this
awful threat, Jadu Babu apparently yielded, promising to eject his
brother. When the villagers saw Hiramani so thick with the Basu ladies,
they prophesied ill-luck for the family, and on learning Jadu
Babu&rsquo;s resolve they remarked that the old woman had not belied
her reputation. As for Nalini, he knew that something was in the wind,
but carefully avoided broaching the subject to his brother, lest he
should widen the breach. Like a sacrificial goat, he waited for the
stroke to fall on his devoted head. Shortly afterwards, Jadu Babu told
his wife to make arrangements for setting up a separate establishment.
Her heart leapt for joy. She cooked twice the number of dishes usually
prepared for her husband&rsquo;s midday meal, and anxiously waited for
him in her kitchen.</p>
<p>Jadu Babu went about his duties as usual, never mentioning the
coming separation to Nalini. After bathing at 11 A.M. he took Nalini
into the latter&rsquo;s kitchen, and asked his sister-in-law to give
them something to eat. The pair sat down to a hastily-prepared repast,
Jadu Babu chatting and joking with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1825" href="#xd26e1825" name="xd26e1825">131</a>]</span>brother
according to his wont. After dinner he took his betel box and adjourned
to the parlour for rumination and a siesta. Nalini and his wife were
surprised by Jadu Babu&rsquo;s behaviour. They dared not ask him why he
had invited himself to eat with them, but waited anxiously for further
developments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the elder wife was eating her heart with vexation and
forming resolutions to give her husband a curtain lecture. But he slept
that night in the parlour and on the morrow took both meals with
Nalini. When a woman fails to gain her object she is apt to take refuge
in tears, which are generally enough to force a mere man to bend to her
wishes. Jadu&rsquo;s wife watched for an opportunity of having it out
with her husband. On finding him alone, she burst into lamentations,
beating her heart and praying that God would put an end to her wretched
life. He calmly asked what was the matter and, on receiving no reply,
went to bed. Presently she asked, &ldquo;What has induced you to put me
to shame?&rdquo; Jadu Babu pretended ignorance, and thus made her only
the more angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you <i>Neka</i>&rdquo; (buffoon), she groaned,
&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you swear to separate from Nalini, and have you not
taken all your meals with him ever since? Is that the action of a
truthful man?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1834" href=
"#xd26e1834" name="xd26e1834">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should like to know how Nalini has injured
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that he is your enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! Where could I
find a brother so faithful and obedient as he? You wish to live apart
from him? Very well; I have made separate arrangements for you.&rdquo;
Then in dispassionate tones Jadu Babu pointed out the treachery of
Debendra and his parasite. The woman&rsquo;s eyes were opened. She fell
at her husband&rsquo;s feet and implored his pardon. Then she suddenly
rose, went across the courtyard to Nalini&rsquo;s room, and knocked at
his door. He came out and, seeing his sister-in-law there at an unusual
hour, asked anxiously whether Jadu was ill. She reassured him and took
him by the hand to his brother, in whose presence she asked him to
forgive and forget the offence. Nalini was nothing loth; and harmony
was soon restored in the family.</p>
<p>Meanwhile old Hiramani had not failed to report progress to her
patron daily. He was delighted to think that the rift in the Basu lute
was widening, and promised her a handsome reward when the estrangement
should take place.</p>
<p>On learning the failure of the plot, he paid Hiramani a surprise
visit, abused her roundly, and, when she retorted in the like strain,
he administered a wholesome <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1845"
href="#xd26e1845" name="xd26e1845">133</a>]</span>correction with his
shoe. On his departure she ran to Jadu Babu&rsquo;s house intending to
have it out with his wife for her breach of faith. The doorkeeper,
however, roughly denied her entrance; and when she threatened to report
him to his mistress, he ran her out by the neck. Hiramani went home in
a state of impatient anger and despair, and for several days she dared
not show her face in the village. The spell cast by her malice was
broken. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1847" href="#xd26e1847"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One chilly morning in February a Mohammadan neighbour
of Nalini&rsquo;s named Sadhu Sheikh burst into his parlour crying,
&ldquo;Chota Babu, Chota Babu (lit. &lsquo;little babu,&rsquo; used for
younger brother, to distinguish him from the elder, styled &lsquo;bara
babu&rsquo;), Sir&aacute;ji is dying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Nalini looking up from a law book
which he was studying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you know my sister, Chota Babu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, what&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been ill for three days, with excruciating internal
pains; what am I to do, B&aacute;buji?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is treating her?&rdquo; asked Nalini.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abdullah has been giving her the usual remedies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he is a peasant and knows nothing of medicine. You
should not have called him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, we are poor folk. Abdullah is very clever and his fee is
a mere trifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What drugs has he been administering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Homopotik</i> (homoeopathic), they are called.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1877" href="#xd26e1877" name=
"xd26e1877">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you had better return home at once to find out how she is
progressing. Let me know if she grows worse and I will send Hriday
Doctor. Don&rsquo;t trouble about his fees; I will pay them myself. Why
did you not come to me earlier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadhu muttered some words, which Nalini could not distinguish, and
left the room hurriedly. After waiting for an hour for news, Nalini
threw a wrapper over his shoulders and went to Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s
cottage. On nearing it he learnt from Sadhu&rsquo;s loud lamentations
that she was beyond the reach of medicine; so, after a few words of
sympathy, he went home.</p>
<p>Presently Sadhu sallied forth to ask the neighbours&rsquo; help in
carrying the dead body to burial. One and all refused to lay a hand on
it because, they said, she had lived with an unbeliever. In dire
distress Sadhu again appealed to Nalini, who summoned the chief
inhabitants of the Musalm&aacute;np&aacute;ra (Mohammadan quarter) to
his house and ordered them to take Siraji&rsquo;s body to the burial
ground. They reluctantly agreed to do so, and assembled at
Sadhu&rsquo;s cottage; but at the last moment all of them refused to
touch the corpse. Nalini was puzzled by their behaviour. He asked for
an explanation, whereon the Mohammadans whispered together and nudged a
grey-beard, who became their spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the fact is
Sir&aacute;ji lived with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1886" href=
"#xd26e1886" name="xd26e1886">136</a>]</span>Debendra Babu and was
actually made <i>enceinte</i> by him. In order to save himself from
exposure and shame, Debendra Babu got Abdullah to administer powerful
drugs to the woman. After taking these she was attacked by violent
pains in the abdomen and vomiting, which ended in her death. The
Chaukidar (village watchman) knows all the facts, and he is sure to
give information to the police. You know, sir, that no one would dare
to touch a corpse without their permission, if there is any suspicion
of foul play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nalini was greatly surprised; he asked S&aacute;dhu whether the old
man&rsquo;s words were true and, getting no reply except a significant
silence, said: &ldquo;You may now go about your business, but mind I
shall expect you all to assemble here and carry Sir&aacute;ji to the
burial ground as soon as the police give you leave to do so&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There was a chorus of assent, and the crowd dispersed. Nalini was
about to return home too, when the Chaukidar came in and told him that
he had reported Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s death to the Sub-Inspector of
police, who had ordered him not to permit the corpse to be touched by
any one until his arrival.</p>
<p>About three o&rsquo;clock on the same day Nalini heard that the
police had come to investigate the cause of Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s
death. He went at once to S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s house, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1897" href="#xd26e1897" name=
"xd26e1897">137</a>]</span>where the Sub-Inspector was recording the
statements of eye-witnesses. When Abdullah&rsquo;s turn came, the
police officer surveyed him from head to foot, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of you before; what is your
occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am a Hakim (doctor).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have a little cultivation and sometimes lend
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you attend the deceased woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was called in by S&aacute;dhu a week ago, and treated
her for fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice mess you have made of the case too! Swear on the Quran
that you gave her no poison or drug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am ready to declare in the name of God and His Prophet
that I gave her nothing but <i>homopotik</i>, only <i>nuxo bomicka</i>
(nux vomica) in doses which would not have harmed a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, remember you are on your oath. Did you administer
anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abdullah&rsquo;s shaking limbs proved that he was terribly
apprehensive of evil consequences to himself. He muttered, &ldquo;I
gave her a little <i>patal</i>-juice too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; said the Sub-Inspector. &ldquo;Now all
present will follow me.&rdquo; With the assistance of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1931" href="#xd26e1931" name=
"xd26e1931">138</a>]</span>his constable and chaukidars, he led them to
Debendra Babu&rsquo;s house. The latter received them in his parlour.
He affected to be surprised and shocked by the news of
Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is strange,&rdquo; retorted the Sub-Inspector.
&ldquo;Abdullah here has sworn that he poisoned her at your
request,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debendra Babu became ashen pale, but he soon regained
self-possession. Turning on Abdullah he shouted:&mdash;&ldquo;How dare
you say that I gave you any such orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babu,&rdquo; whined Abdullah, &ldquo;I never said so. The
Darogaji is mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sub-Inspector perceived that, all the witnesses being tenants of
Debendra Babu, there was no hope of getting them to stick to any
statement inculpating him. He sulkily told the Mohammadans present that
they might bury Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s corpse, and accompanied Debendra
Babu to his house, where he was royally entertained till next morning.
However, on taking leave, he hinted that enough evidence had been
secured to warrant his reporting the case as one of causing abortion by
means of drugs, and that the <i>Pulis Saheb</i> (District
Superintendent) would probably order further investigation. Debendra
Babu was seriously alarmed by the implied threat. Visions of
jail&mdash;perchance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1945" href=
"#xd26e1945" name="xd26e1945">139</a>]</span>transportation across the
dark ocean&mdash;floated in his sensorium. He resolved to submit the
case to an astrologer.</p>
<p>Gobardhan Chakravarti was an old Brahman neighbour who lived by
casting nativities, giving weather and crop forecasts, and prophesying
good or evil things in proportion to the fee he received. Debendra Babu
paid him a visit next morning and was received with the servile
courtesy due to a wealthy client. After beating about the bush for a
while he said: &ldquo;My fate just now seems very unpropitious; when
may I expect better times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gobardhan covered a slate with mysterious calculations and, after
poring over them for ten or fifteen minutes, he looked up with the
remark:&mdash;&ldquo;Your luck is really atrocious and has been so for
more than three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true, but what I want to know is&mdash;how long is this
going to last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that you may expect one misfortune after another;
I can&rsquo;t quite see the end of your evil destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious! what shall I do? Are there no means of
conjuring it away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, the Sh&aacute;stras prescribe certain
<i>Grahasanti</i> (propitiation of planets) processes, which will
enable you to counteract the influence of malign stars.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1962" href="#xd26e1962" name=
"xd26e1962">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>The cunning bait was swallowed by Debendra Babu, who asked:
&ldquo;How much would these ceremonies cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thinking out the maximum amount he could decently demand, the
astrologer said: &ldquo;About one hundred rupees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s far too much,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Do you want to ruin me? Can&rsquo;t you do it for
less?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a pice less. I could perform a <i>jog</i> (sacrifice) for
as little as ten rupees; but such maimed rites are quite contrary to
the Sh&aacute;stras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you guarantee definite results for Rs. 100?&rdquo; asked
Debendra Babu anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise nothing; if you have faith in my ceremonies, you
must pay me my own price; if not&mdash;I leave you to Fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have implicit faith in you,&rdquo; groaned Debendra Babu,
who was now terribly alarmed, &ldquo;and will pay you Rs. 100
to-morrow, but please don&rsquo;t delay; the matter is very
pressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gobardhan agreed to the proposal; but seeing that his client was
loth to go and evidently had something on his mind, he
remarked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a wise man consults a physician, he always discloses his
symptoms. You must be quite frank and tell me how your affairs have
been progressing lately, in order that I may address my incantations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1985" href="#xd26e1985" name=
"xd26e1985">141</a>]</span>to the proper quarter. Be sure that I will
divulge nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged Debendra Babu revealed his relations with
Sir&aacute;ji, confessed that he had bribed Abdullah to administer a
powerful drug to her, and expatiated on the very awkward predicament in
which her sudden death had placed him.</p>
<p>Gobardhan listened with breathless attention and then remarked:
&ldquo;You have acted rightly in telling me the whole truth. I will
perform a <i>homa</i> (burnt sacrifice) and verily believe that it will
have the desired effect. Let me have Rs. 200 and I will set about it at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debendra Babu groaned inwardly at the thought of so heavy an
expenditure; but after all, the prospect of escaping deadly peril was
well worth Rs. 200. So he returned home and thence despatched the
amount in currency notes to Gobardhan.</p>
<p>The astrologer spent about Rs. 5 on <i>ghi</i> (clarified butter),
rice, and plantains for his <i>homa</i> sacrifice, and completed it in
three days. Then he called on the police Sub-Inspector, who received
him cordially. After the usual compliments had been, exchanged,
Grobardhan asked how his host was faring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are not going well with me,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Most of the people in those parts are miserably poor; and what I
can extract from the well-to-do <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2006" href="#xd26e2006" name="xd26e2006">142</a>]</span>hardly
suffices for my horse-keep. <i>Th&aacute;kurji</i> (a term used in
addressing Brahmans), I want you to examine my palm and say when good
times are coming for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After poring over the proffered hand for fully a minute, muttering
and shaking his head the while, Gobardhan said: &ldquo;I am delighted
to tell you that your good star is in the ascendant. Very soon you will
make something handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so!&rdquo; observed the policeman,
&ldquo;but it is impossible. I have only one likely case on my file,
and prospects are not brilliant even in that quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in answer to leading questions from Gobardhan, he told the
story of Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s death&mdash;adding that he had decided
to send Debendra Babu and Abdullah up for trial, but doubted whether he
could adduce sufficient evidence to convict them of murder or anything
like it.</p>
<p>Gobardhan asked: &ldquo;Now, why should you lose such a splendid
opportunity of making money?&rdquo; and seeing the policeman&rsquo;s
eyes twinkle, he went on, &ldquo;Oh, you need not appear in this
transaction yourself. I will do the needful. Tell me frankly&mdash;how
much money would satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not run the risk of reporting the case as false for
less than Rs. 100.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2022"
href="#xd26e2022" name="xd26e2022">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too much,&rdquo; was the wily astrologer&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;Mention a reasonable sum, and I will see what can be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will take Rs. 75, and not a pice less; and
understand, if the money is not paid before this evening, I will send
Debendra Babu up for trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; I will call on him at once and frighten him into
paying up; but I must have something for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you can get Rs. 75 from the defendant you may
keep Rs. 15 as commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gobardhan returned home, took the required amount from the Rs. 200
paid him by Debendra Babu, and handed it privately to the
Sub-Inspector, who swore by all the gods that he would take no further
steps against the inculpated men.</p>
<p>Knowing well that the policeman would keep faith with a Brahman,
Gobardhan went straight to Debendra Babu with the glad news that the
<i>homa</i> sacrifice had been completely successful, and not a hair of
his head would be injured. Debendra felt as though a mountain was
lifted from his heart; he stooped to wipe the dust from
Gobardhan&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>On learning a few days later that the case had been reported to
headquarters as false, he was firmly convinced that Gobardhan&rsquo;s
magical rites had saved him from ruin, and presented him with a bonus
of Rs. 50. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2040" href="#xd26e2040"
name="xd26e2040">144</a>]</span>Nalini Babu was not long in
ascertaining how the land lay. He was exasperated by the sordid
wrong-doing which reached his ears and resolved to report it to the
District Magistrate. But in the end he kept silent, because Sadhu came
to him with tearful eyes, saying that he had already suffered deep
humiliation; and if old scandals were raked up, the community would
certainly excommunicate him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2042"

<p class="first">Hiramani did not forget the thrashing given her by
Debendra Babu for failing to cause a rupture between the Basu brothers.
She took a vow of vengeance and laid in wait for an opportunity of
fulfilling it. Meeting him one day in the village street, she asked
with an air of mystery:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; replied Debendra Babu
carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It concerns the woman Sir&aacute;ji,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>
<p>All Debendra Babu&rsquo;s fears revived; he exclaimed: &ldquo;Speak
plainly, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter stands thus. You know that her case was hushed up
by the police? Well, I hear on good authority that the District
Magistrate has received an anonymous letter relating the real cause of
her death and has ordered a fresh investigation. So I am afraid you
will soon be in hot water again. As I am your well-wisher in spite of
the cruel treatment I have received, I think it my duty to warn you of
this new danger.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2058" href=
"#xd26e2058" name="xd26e2058">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hiramani spoke in faltering accents and wiped away an imaginary tear
with the corner of her cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did yon learn all this?&rdquo; asked Debendra Babu in
deep anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the news only last night from the wife of the new
Sub-Inspector who has come here on transfer. On paying my respects to
her, I was told in confidence that her husband had orders to make a
searching inquiry into the cause of Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debendra Babu saw that his secret was at the woman&rsquo;s
discretion. He answered in an apologetic tone: &ldquo;It was certainly
foolish of me to lose my temper with you, but I had some provocation.
Forgive me, and let bye-gones be bye-gones. Whom do you suspect of
sending the anonymous letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiramani bit her lips; she knew the author, who was none other than
herself, and replied: &ldquo;It might have been written by Jadu Babu;
but I suspect his brother Nalini, who is as venomous as a snake and
hates you mortally&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Debendra Babu stamped his foot in annoyance and, after musing
awhile, asked, &ldquo;What would you advise me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiramani wagged her head sententiously. &ldquo;Babuji, I am afraid
you are in a serious scrape. The matter has gone too far to be hushed
up a second time. You cannot do anything directly without increasing
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2074" href="#xd26e2074" name=
"xd26e2074">147</a>]</span>suspicion which attaches to you; but I will
watch events and keep you informed of all that happens at the police
station. You know I have friends there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debendra Babu was profuse in his thanks. He pressed a couple of
rupees into the old woman&rsquo;s willing palm, saying:
&ldquo;Hiramani, I see that you are really my well-wisher. Come to my
house as often as you like; and if you have anything particular to say
to me, I shall always be glad to hear it&mdash;and grateful
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the pair separated, and Hiramani took advantage of the
Babu&rsquo;s invitation by visiting his daughter Kamini that very
evening.</p>
<p>She was made welcome in the inner apartment and sat down for a long
chat, in the course of which she asked after Kamini&rsquo;s
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone out for a stroll,&rdquo; her hostess replied,
&ldquo;but I expect him back every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of her mouth ere a young man came in
hurriedly and, not noticing Hiramani who sat in the shade, asked for a
drink of water. Hiramani doubted not that he was Debendra Babu&rsquo;s
son-in-law, Pulin by name, who had lately come to live with his
wife&rsquo;s family. She introduced herself as a friend of his
father-in-law&rsquo;s and, being very witty when she chose to exert
herself, soon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2086" href=
"#xd26e2086" name="xd26e2086">148</a>]</span>managed to make a
favourable impression on the young man, He asked her to come again
whenever she pleased, adding that he was generally at home after
sunset.</p>
<p>Hiramani had prepared the ground for a further attack. She left the
house with a certainty that she had made a good impression.</p>
<p>Thenceforward hardly a day passed without at least one visit to
Debendra Babu&rsquo;s. Hiramani wormed all Kamini&rsquo;s little
harmless secrets out of her and obtained enough knowledge of the
girl&rsquo;s tastes and habits to serve her own designs.</p>
<p>One day, finding herself alone with Pulin, she threw out dark hints
against his wife&rsquo;s character. The young man&rsquo;s suspicion was
excited. He pressed for more explicit information, but Hiramani shook
her head mysteriously without replying. Pulin insisted on being told
the truth, whereon Hiramani poured out a whispered story of
Kamini&rsquo;s intrigues, mentioning names of male relatives who were
known to frequent the house. Pulin was stung to the quick. Regardless
of a stranger&rsquo;s presence, he called Kamini into the room, abused
her roundly, and declared that he would never live with her again. Then
gathering up a few belongings in a bundle, he quitted the house,
leaving his wife in a flood of tears. Hiramani was overjoyed by the
results of her machinations. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2094" href="#xd26e2094" name="xd26e2094">149</a>]</span>affected
sympathy with the deserted wife, who was too young and innocent to
suspect her of having caused the quarrel.</p>
<p>Debendra Babu had a servant, R&aacute;m Harak by name, who had been
in the family for nearly forty years and was treated as one of them. He
had watched the growing intimacy between Hiramani and the young couple
and, knowing the old woman&rsquo;s character well, endeavoured to
counteract her evil influence. Finding this impossible he sought
Debendra Babu in the parlour, sal&aacute;med profoundly, and stood
erect, without uttering a word. His master asked, with some surprise,
what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; replied R&aacute;m Harak, &ldquo;have
I not served you for two-score years with obedience and fidelity? Have
you ever found me untrue to my salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; I know you are a good and faithful
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mah&aacute;say, you ought to protect me against enemies
of your house. That odious hag, Hiramani, has abused me
foully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, R&aacute;m Harak, it is you who are abusive. What have
you done to offend her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my father and mother,&rdquo; replied R&aacute;m Harak
with his eyes full of tears. &ldquo;Let me explain fully. I have long
since suspected Hiramani of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2109"
href="#xd26e2109" name="xd26e2109">150</a>]</span>making mischief in
this house, and have kept a close watch on her movements. The very day
of Pulin Babu&rsquo;s departure I overheard her whispering all manner
of false insinuations against my young mistress. Then came the quarrel
between husband and wife, which ended in Pulin Babu&rsquo;s leaving
your house. After he had gone I ventured to remonstrate with Hiramani
for poisoning <i>jamai</i> (son-in-law) Babu&rsquo;s mind against his
wife; whereon she overwhelmed me with abuse and actually threatened to
get me dismissed! I want to know whether this woman is mistress of the
family? Am I to have no redress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave all this to me, R&aacute;m Harak, and go to your work.
I&rsquo;ll speak to Hiramani myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babuji, you are treading the matter far too lightly. I would
never have complained on my own account, but I cannot bear to see her
plotting against your daughter&rsquo;s happiness, which she has,
perhaps, destroyed for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debendra Babu went into his inner apartments and, seeing Hiramani
engaged in close conversation with his daughter, he asked her why she
had used bad language to R&aacute;m Harak. The old woman beckoned him
to come outside; and after making sure that no one was listening, she
poured into his ears a long tale of R&aacute;m Harak&rsquo;s misdoings.
He was robbing his master, she declared, taking <i>dasturi</i>
(commission <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2123" href="#xd26e2123"
name="xd26e2123">151</a>]</span>on purchases) at twice the customary
rates. What was far worse, the &ldquo;faithful servant&rdquo; had
spoken freely of Debendra Babu&rsquo;s relations with Sir&aacute;ji in
the village, and it was he who instigated the anonymous letter which
was about to bring the police down on his master. Though all this was
the purest fiction, Debendra Babu swallowed it greedily. He shouted for
R&aacute;m Harak and, on the man&rsquo;s appearance, charged him with
fraud and unfaithfulness to his salt. R&aacute;m Harak stood silent
with folded hands, not deigning to exculpate himself, which so enraged
Debendra Babu that he gave the poor old man a sharp blow on the head
with his shoe, bidding him begone and never to cross his threshold
again. R&aacute;m Harak went to his hut, collected his possessions in a
bundle, and left the house where forty years of his life had been
spent. Hiramani&rsquo;s plans of vengeance were prospering.</p>
<p>Soon after these unpleasant events the new Sub-Inspector of police
arrived at Debendra Babu&rsquo;s house with a warrant for his arrest,
and took him to the station despite loud protests of innocence. There
he applied for bail, which was of course refused, and he spent the
night in the lock-up. Knowing well that he had a very bad case, he
humbled himself so far as to send for Nalini, whom he implored with
folded hands to save him from destruction. Nalini was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2127" href="#xd26e2127" name=
"xd26e2127">152</a>]</span>deeply moved by his appeal. He heartily
despised the fellow&rsquo;s unutterable baseness, but reflected that he
had been an old friend of his father&rsquo;s. He undertook the
prisoner&rsquo;s defence.</p>
<p>In due course Debendra Babu, with Abdullah, was brought before the
Deputy Magistrate of Ghoria on various grave charges. The evidence
established a strong <i>prima facie</i> case against both, and Nalini
Babu reserved his defence. They were committed for trial. When the case
came before the Sessions Judge the Government Pleader (public
prosecutor) adduced many witnesses proving the prisoner&rsquo;s guilt,
the last of whom was Hiramani, who admitted on cross-examination that
she had caused the anonymous letter to be sent to headquarters, which
led to the charge being reopened. She protested that she had done so
from a feeling that so great a crime should not be hushed up. Nalini
Babu, in his turn, put forward some witnesses for the defence; but
their statements were not of material advantage to the prisoner. It
was, in fact, a losing game, but he played it manfully. After all
evidence had been recorded, the Government Pleader was about to sum up
for the prosecution, when the Court rose suddenly, as it was past five
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Nalini was going homewards in the dusk, when he felt a hand laid
timidly on his shoulder. Turning <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2137" href="#xd26e2137" name="xd26e2137">153</a>]</span>sharply
round, he saw an old man standing by his side. On being asked his name
and business, the newcomer whispered some information which must have
interested Nalini greatly for he rubbed his hands, smiled, and nodded
several times. After a few minutes&rsquo; talk the pair went together
to a spot where a palanquin with bearers was waiting. Into it got
Nalini and was carried off at a smart trot, while his companion hobbled
behind.</p>
<p>When the Court assembled next day Nalini thus addressed the judge:
&ldquo;May it please your honour, I have, by the greatest good luck,
obtained certain evidence which will, I think, place this case in a new
light&rdquo;. On getting leave to adduce an additional witness, he
beckoned to an old man, standing at the back of the Court, who entered
the witness-box and declared that his name was R&aacute;m Harak and
that he was a dismissed servant of the prisoner. This was a curious
opening for a witness for the defence, and dead silence fell on the
Court while R&aacute;m Harak proceeded to swear that it was he, and not
Debendra Babu, who had been intimate with the deceased, and that she
had poisoned herself to avoid excommunication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she tell you so herself?&rdquo; asked the judge
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your highness; I learnt this only yesterday from Maina
Bibi, Karim&rsquo;s own sister; Piyari Bibi, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2145" href="#xd26e2145" name=
"xd26e2145">154</a>]</span>S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s daughter; and Nasiban
Bibi, his sister-in-law, who all lived with the deceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government Pleader at once objected to this statement being
recorded, as it was hearsay. Nalini, however, assured the judge that
the eye-witnesses were in attendance, and called them, one by one, to
give evidence. Passing strange was their story. On the evening of
Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s death they found her writhing in agony on the
floor and, on being questioned, she gasped out that she could bear her
kinsfolks&rsquo; tyranny no longer. They had just told her that she was
to be excommunicated for intriguing with an infidel. So she had got
some yellow arsenic from the domes (low-caste leather-dressers) and
swallowed several <i>tolas</i> weight of the poison in milk. The other
women were thunderstruck. They sat down beside her and mingled their
lamentations until Sir&aacute;ji&rsquo;s sufferings ended for ever.
They afterwards agreed to say nothing about the cause of her death for
fear of the police. But R&aacute;m Harak had come to them privately and
frightened them into promising to tell the whole truth, by pointing out
the awful consequences of an innocent man&rsquo;s conviction. Their
evidence was not shaken by the Government Pleader&rsquo;s
cross-examination, and it was corroborated by a dome, who swore that
Sir&aacute;ji had got some arsenic from him a few days before her
death, on the pretext that it was wanted in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2152" href="#xd26e2152" name=
"xd26e2152">155</a>]</span>order to poison some troublesome village
dogs. After consulting with the jury for a few minutes, the judge
informed Nalini that his client was acquitted, and Debendra Babu left
the Court, as the newspapers say, &ldquo;without a stain on his
character&rdquo;. Seeing R&aacute;m Harak standing near the door with
folded hands, he clasped the good old man to his bosom, with many
protestations of gratitude, and begged him to forgive the injustice
with which he had been treated.</p>
<p>When R&aacute;m Harak found himself alone with his master at the
close of this exciting day, he repeated the vile insinuations which
Hiramani had made regarding the daughter&rsquo;s character. Debendra
Babu was highly indignant and vowed that the scandal-monger should
never cross his threshold again. He then implored R&aacute;m Harak to
trace his son-in-law, authorising him to offer any reparation he might
ask. The old man smiled, and left the house, but returned a quarter of
an hour later with a Sany&aacute;si (religious mendicant) who revealed
himself as the missing Pulin. Debendra Babu received him with warm
embraces and many entreaties for pardon; while Pulin said modestly that
he alone was to blame, for he ought not to have believed the aspersions
cast on his wife by Hiramani, which led him to quit the house in
disgust. He added that R&aacute;m Harak had found him telling his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2156" href="#xd26e2156" name=
"xd26e2156">156</a>]</span>beads near a temple, and persuaded him to
wait close at hand until he had opened Debendra Babu&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the whole house echoed with songs and laughter. Debendra
Babu rewarded R&aacute;m Harak&rsquo;s fidelity with a grant of
rent-free land, and publicly placed a magnificent turban on his head.
He resolved to celebrate his own escape from jail by feasting the
neighbours. The entire arrangements were left in the hands of the two
Basus, who managed matters so admirably that every one was more than
satisfied and Debendra Babu&rsquo;s fame was spread far and wide. When
things resumed their normal aspect, he held a confab with the brothers
as to the punishment which should be meted out to Hiramani, and it was
unanimously resolved to send her to Coventry. They, therefore, forbade
the villagers to admit her into their houses, and the shopkeepers to
supply her wants. Hiramani soon found Kadampur too hot to hold her and
took her departure for ever, to every one&rsquo;s intense relief.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a penniless Hindu marries into a wealthy family
he is sorely tempted to live with, and upon, his father-in-law. But the
ease thus secured is unattended by dignity. The
<i>gharjam&aacute;i</i>, &ldquo;son-in-law of the house,&rdquo; as he
is styled, shocks public opinion, which holds it disgraceful for an
able-bodied man to eat the bread of idleness. Pulin incurred a certain
degree of opprobrium by quartering himself on Debendra Babu; neighbours
treated him with scant courtesy, and the very household servants made
him feel that he was a person of small importance. He bore contumely
with patience, looking forward to the time when Debendra Babu&rsquo;s
decease would give him a recognised position. His wife was far more
ambitious. She objected strongly to sharing her husband&rsquo;s loss of
social standing and frequently reproached him with submitting to be her
father&rsquo;s <i>annad&aacute;s</i> (rice-slave).</p>
<p>So, one morning, he poured his sorrows into Nalini&rsquo;s
sympathetic ear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2174" href=
"#xd26e2174" name="xd26e2174">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mah&aacute;say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know that people
are inclined to blame me for living in idleness, and I do indeed long
to chalk out a career for myself. But I don&rsquo;t know how to set
about it and have no patron to back me. Do you happen to know of any
job which would give me enough to live on? Salary is less an object
with me than prospects. I would gladly accept a mastership in some high
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right in seeking independence,&rdquo; replied
Nalini, &ldquo;and I shall be glad to help you. But lower-grade
teachers are miserably paid, and their prospects are no better. It is
only graduates who can aspire to a head-mastership. Are you
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, but I passed the F.A. examination in
1897.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, you are a Diamond Jubilee man&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
good omen,&rdquo; rejoined Nalini, with a shade of sarcasm in his
voice. &ldquo;What were your English text-books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read Milton&rsquo;s <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>,
Dryden&rsquo;s <i>Holy Grail</i>, and many other poems, but I&rsquo;m
not sure of their titles after all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nalini suspected that his friend&rsquo;s English lore was somewhat
rusty. In order to test him further, he asked, &ldquo;Can you tell me
who wrote &lsquo;Life is real, life is earnest,&rsquo;&mdash;that line
applies to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulin fidgeted about before answering. &ldquo;It must <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2195" href="#xd26e2195" name=
"xd26e2195">159</a>]</span>have been Tennyson&mdash;or was it
Wordsworth? I never could keep poetry in my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nalini thought that an F.A. might have remembered Longfellow&rsquo;s
<i>Psalm of Life</i>, but he refrained from airing superior
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any mathematics?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mathematics!&rdquo; replied Pulin joyously. &ldquo;Why,
they&rsquo;re my <i>forte</i>&mdash;I am quite at home in arithmetic,
algebra, and geometry. Please ask me any question you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us have Prop. 30, Book I. of Euclid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulin rattled off Proposition 13 of that book, without the aid of a
diagram. Nalini now saw that the young man&rsquo;s mental equipment was
of the slenderest description. He said, &ldquo;Well, you may call on me
another day, when I may be able to tell you of some vacancy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pulin, however, would take no denial. He became so insistent that
Nalini reluctantly gave him a letter of introduction to Babu
Kaliprasanna Som, Secretary of the R&aacute;mnagar High School, who, he
said, was looking about him for a fourth master. Pulin lost no time in
delivering it and was immediately appointed to the vacant post.</p>
<p>English education in Bengal is not regarded as a key which opens the
door of a glorious literature, but simply and solely as a
stepping-stone in the path of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2218"
href="#xd26e2218" name="xd26e2218">160</a>]</span>worldly success. The
Department seems to aim at turning out clerks and lawyers in reckless
profusion. Moreover, academic degrees are tariffed in the marriage
market. The &ldquo;F.A.&rdquo; commands a far higher price than the
&ldquo;entrance-passed,&rdquo; while an M.A. has his pick of the
richest and prettiest girls belonging to his class. Hence parents take
a keen interest in their boys&rsquo; progress and constantly urge them
to excel in class. With such lessons ringing in his ears, the Bengali
schoolboy is consumed with a desire to master his text-books. The great
difficulty is to tear him away from them, and insist on his giving
sufficient time to manly games. When a new teacher takes the helm, he
is closely watched in order to test his competence. The older lads take
a cruel pleasure in plying him with questions which they have already
solved from the Dictionary. Pulin did not emerge from this ordeal with
credit, and the boys concocted a written complaint of his shortcomings,
which they despatched to the Secretary of the School Committee, The
answer was a promise to redress their grievances.</p>
<p>At 10.30 next morning Kaliprasanna Babu entered Pulin&rsquo;s
classroom and stood listening to his method of teaching English
literature. Presently one of the boys asked him to explain the
difference between &ldquo;fort&rdquo; and &ldquo;fortress&rdquo;. After
scratching his head for fully half a minute he replied that the first
was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2222" href="#xd26e2222" name=
"xd26e2222">161</a>]</span>castle defended by men, while the second had
a female garrison! The Secretary was quite satisfied. He left the room
and sent Pulin a written notice of dismissal. The latter was
disheartened beyond measure by this unkind stroke of fortune. He shook
the dust of R&aacute;mnagar from his feet and returned home to lay his
sorrows before Nalini, seasoning the story with remarks highly
derogatory to Kaliprasanna Babu&rsquo;s character. In order to get rid
of an importunate suitor Nalini gave him another letter of
introduction, this time to an old acquaintance named Debnath Lahiri who
was head clerk in the office of Messrs. Kerr &amp; Dunlop, one of the
largest mercantile firms of Calcutta. Pulin was heartily sick of
school-mastering, and the prospect of making a fortune in business
filled his soul with joy. He borrowed Rs. 30 from Debendra Babu and
took the earliest train for Calcutta. On arriving there he joined a
mess of waifs and strays like himself, who herded in a small room and
clubbed their pice to provide meals. Then he waited on Debnath Babu,
whom he found installed in a sumptuous office overlooking the river
Hughli. The great man glanced at his credentials and, with an
appearance of cordiality, promised to let him know in case a vacancy
occurred in the office. For nearly a month Pulin called daily for news
at Messrs. Kerr &amp; Dunlop&rsquo;s, and generally managed to waylay
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2224" href="#xd26e2224" name=
"xd26e2224">162</a>]</span>head clerk, whose reply was invariably,
&ldquo;I have nothing to suit you at present&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One morning, however, he was stopped by the darw&aacute;n
(doorkeeper) who told him gruffly that the &ldquo;Bara Babu did not
like to have outsiders hanging about the office&rdquo;. The baffled
suitor reflected on his miserable position. He had just eleven rupees
and two pice left, which he calculated would last him, with strict
economy, for another fortnight. When they were spent, he would have to
return crestfallen to Kadampur. But could he face the neighbours&rsquo;
sneers, the servants&rsquo; contumely&mdash;worse than all, his
wife&rsquo;s bitter tongue? No, that was not to be thought of. It were
better to plunge into the river whose turbid waters rolled only a few
feet away.</p>
<p>Pulin was roused from this unpleasant train of thought by hearing
his name pronounced. It came from a well-dressed man, who was just
entering Messrs. Kerr &amp; Dunlop&rsquo;s office, welcomed by a
sal&aacute;m from the surly doorkeeper. Pulin was delighted to
recognise in the stranger a certain Kisari Mohan Chatterji, who had
taught him English in the General Assembly&rsquo;s College more than a
decade back. In a few words he told his sad story and learnt that
Kisari Babu had taken the same step as he himself contemplated, with
the result that he was now head clerk in Messrs. Kerr &amp;
Dunlop&rsquo;s export <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2230" href=
"#xd26e2230" name="xd26e2230">163</a>]</span>department. This news
augured well for his own ambition, but poor Pulin was disgusted on
hearing that no less than three vacancies had occurred in as many
weeks, and that all had been filled by relatives of Babu Debnath
Lahiri. Kisari Babu added: &ldquo;A junior clerk is to be appointed
to-morrow. Write out an application in your very best hand, with copies
of your testimonials, and bring it to me here this evening at five.
I&rsquo;ll see that it reaches our manager, Henderson Saheb.&rdquo;
Pulin punctually followed his friend&rsquo;s advice, and dreamed all
night of wealth beyond a miser&rsquo;s utmost ambition.</p>
<p>On arriving at Messrs. Kerr &amp; Dunlop&rsquo;s office next morning
he joined a crowd of twenty or thirty young men who were bent on a like
errand. His spirits sank to zero, nor were they raised when after
hanging about in the rain for nearly two hours the aspirants were told
that the vacancy had been filled up. Thereupon the forlorn group
dispersed, cursing their ill-luck and muttering insinuations against
Mr. Henderson and his head clerk. Pulin, however, lingered behind. By
tendering a rupee to the doorkeeper he got a slip of paper and pencil,
with which he indited a piteous appeal to Kisari Babu, and a promise
that it should reach him. Presently his friend came out in a desperate
hurry, with a stylograph behind his ear, and his hands laden with
papers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2234" href="#xd26e2234"
name="xd26e2234">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I anticipated,&rdquo; he whispered to
Pulin. &ldquo;The head clerk has persuaded Henderson Saheb to bestow
the post on his wife&rsquo;s nephew. But don&rsquo;t be disheartened. I
will speak to our Saheb about you this very day. Come here at five to
learn the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulin did so and was overjoyed to find that he had been appointed
probationary clerk in the export department on Rs. 20 per mensem, in
supersession of Debnath Babu&rsquo;s nominee.</p>
<p>On the morrow he entered on his new duties with some trepidation,
but Kisari Babu took him under his wing and spared no pains to
&ldquo;teach him the ropes&rdquo;. Pulin spent his evenings in
furbishing up his English and arithmetic, mastered the whole art of
book-keeping, and, being naturally intelligent, he soon had the office
routine at his fingers&rsquo; ends. He grasped the fact that a young
man who wishes to succeed in life must make himself indispensable. In
course of time Pulin&rsquo;s industry and trustworthiness attracted the
attention of Mr. Henderson, who confirmed him as clerk, with a salary
of Rs. 35.</p>
<p>But every cup has its bitter drop; and Pulin&rsquo;s was the
persistent enmity of the head clerk, who bore him a grudge for ousting
his wife&rsquo;s nephew and seized every opportunity of annoying him.
Leagued with the arch-enemy were two subordinate clerks,
Gy&aacute;nendra and Lakshminarain by name, who belonged to Debnath
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2244" href="#xd26e2244" name=
"xd26e2244">165</a>]</span>Babu&rsquo;s <i>g&uacute;sti</i> (family).
This trio so managed matters that all the hardest and most thankless
work fell to Pulin&rsquo;s lot. He bore their pin-pricks with
equanimity, secure in the constant support of Kisari Babu.</p>
<p>One muggy morning in August he awoke with a splitting headache, the
harbinger of an attack of fever, and was obliged to inform the head
clerk, by means of a note, of his inability to attend office. An answer
was brought by Gy&aacute;nendra to the effect that three days&rsquo;
leave of absence was granted, but that his work must be carried on by
some other clerk. He was, therefore, ordered to send the key of his
desk by the bearer. For three days the patient endured alternations of
heat and cold; but his malady yielded to quinine, and on the fourth he
was able to resume work.</p>
<p>Soon after reaching the office, he was accosted by one of the
bearers, named R&aacute;mtonu, who told him that <i>the Bara
Saheb</i>wished to see him at once. The moment he entered the
manager&rsquo;s sanctum he saw that something unpleasant had occurred.
Without wishing him good morning, as usual, Mr. Henderson handed him a
cheque and asked sternly whether he had filled it up. Pulin examined
the document, which turned out to be an order on the Standard Bank to
pay T&aacute;rak Ghose &amp; Co. Rs. 200, signed by Mr. Henderson. He
was obliged to admit that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2256"
href="#xd26e2256" name="xd26e2256">166</a>]</span>payee&rsquo;s name,
as also the amount in words and figures, seemed to be in his
handwriting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined the manager, &ldquo;and the signature is
very like my own; but it is a forgery. Do you hear me, Babu, a
<span class="sc">forgery</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Pulin&rsquo;s disordered senses the room, with its furniture and
Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s angry face, seemed to be turning round. He gasped
out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ill, sir!&rdquo; and sank into a chair. The
manager mistook the remains of fever for a tacit admission of guilt. He
waited till Pulin had regained a share of his wits and said gravely:
&ldquo;I did not think that one whom I trusted with my cheque-book
would act thus. Now you will search your books, to see whether they
contain a record of any payment of the kind, and return with them in
half an hour. But I must warn you that if this forgery is traced to
you, I shall have to call in the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulin staggered back to his room in despair and observed that
Gy&aacute;nendra and Lakshminarain, who sat at the next desk, were
evidently enjoying his mental agony. Alas! the books showed no trace of
any payment to T&aacute;rak Ghose &amp; Co. He wrung his hands in great
distress and sat bewildered, until R&aacute;mtonu came to summon him to
the manager&rsquo;s tribunal. In the corridor R&aacute;mtonu glanced
round, to make sure that no one was within hearing, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2267" href="#xd26e2267" name=
"xd26e2267">167</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Babuji.
You did me a good turn, and I may be able to help you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This R&aacute;mtonu was an office menial hailing from the district
of G&aacute;ya, in Behar. He was an intelligent man, but rather
unlicked, and was the butt of the younger clerks, who delighted in
mocking his uncouth up-country dialect. Pulin, however, had never
joined in &ldquo;ragging&rdquo; him, and, on one occasion, he lent
R&aacute;mtonu Rs. 7 for his wife, who was about to increase the
population of G&aacute;ya. Gratitude for kindness is a marked trait in
the Indian character, and Pulin bethought him of the old fable of the
Lion and Mouse. He asked: &ldquo;Why, what do you know about
<i>lekha-para</i> (reading and writing)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; rejoined R&aacute;mtonu. &ldquo;We must
not loiter, for we should be suspected of plotting together. Come to
the Saheb&rsquo;s room. I shall be admitted, for he knows that I
don&rsquo;t understand English. All I ask is that you will clasp your
hands as a signal when I may come forward and tell my story,&rdquo;</p>
<p>A European police officer was seated by Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s side,
engaged in writing from his dictation. They looked up, and the manager
asked whether Pulin had found any record of the payment in dispute.</p>
<p>On receiving a negative answer, he said: &ldquo;Then I shall be
obliged to hand you over to the police&rdquo;. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2281" href="#xd26e2281" name=
"xd26e2281">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pulin clasped his hands in a mute appeal for mercy, whereon
R&aacute;mtonu stepped forward. Carefully extracting a folded sheet of
foolscap from the pocket of his <i>chapkan</i> (a tight-fitting
garment, worn by nearly all classes in full dress), he spread it out on
the table and respectfully asked the manager to run his eye over
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; remarked the latter, with great surprise,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s some one has been copying my signature&mdash;and
Pulin&rsquo;s writing too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes were now bent on the incriminating document. It was made up
of many fragments of paper, carefully pasted on a sheet of foolscap,
and bore the words, &ldquo;T&aacute;rak Ghose &amp; Co., two hundred
rupees, 200,&rdquo; repeated at least twenty times. Below was
&ldquo;A.G. Henderson,&rdquo; also multiplied many-fold. The manager
asked where R&aacute;mtonu had found the paper, and received the
following answer:&mdash;&ldquo;Your Highness, Pulin Babu here did not
come to office on Monday; and for the next few days his work was done
by Gy&aacute;nendra Babu, who got the keys of his desk. I knew that he
and some other clerks detested Pulin Babu, so I watched their movements
narrowly, to see whether they would try to get him into a scrape, and
more than once I surprised Gy&aacute;nendra and Lakshminarain
whispering together. On Tuesday neither of them left the office for
lunch with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2291" href="#xd26e2291"
name="xd26e2291">169</a>]</span>the other clerks, and I seized some
pretext for entering the room where they sit. Gy&aacute;nendra roughly
bade me begone; so I went to the verandah outside and peeped through
the <i>jilmils</i> (Venetian blinds) of a window close to their desk.
Lakshminarain was copying some English words from a paper on his left
side, while the other clerk looked on, nodding and shaking his head
from time to time. After writing in this fashion for a while,
Lakshminarain took a sheet of notepaper covered with writing and copied
the signature many times, until both babus were satisfied with the
result. Then I saw Gy&aacute;nendra unlock Pulin Babu&rsquo;s desk,
take out a cheque-book, and hand it to the other man, who filled up the
counterfoil and body of one blank cheque, glancing sometimes at the
paper in front of him. He returned it to Gy&aacute;nendra who placed it
in a pocket-book. After tearing up the papers they had used and
throwing them into the waste-paper basket, they left the room. I ran
round, carefully avoiding them, picked the fragments of paper out of
the basket, tied them in a corner of my <i>gamcha</i> (wrapper), and
left the office quickly, asking the doorkeeper what direction they had
taken. When he said that they had turned northwards, I guessed that
they were off to the Bank, in order to cash the cheque, and sure enough
I overtook them not more than a <i>rassi</i> from the office. Following
them at a little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2302" href=
"#xd26e2302" name="xd26e2302">170</a>]</span>distance on the other side
of the street, I saw them stop outside the Standard Bank and look
anxiously around. Presently a schoolboy passed by, whom they hailed
and, after talking for a while, Gy&aacute;nendra handed him the cheque
with a small linen money-bag, and pointed to the door of the Bank. The
lad went inside, while both babus waited round the corner. In a short
time he came out and handed the bag full of money to Gy&aacute;nendra,
who gave him something and hurried back to the office with his
companion. Putting two and two together I felt assured that those
clerks had forged the cheque; and had I known where Pulin Babu lived, I
would certainly have communicated my suspicions to him. Having to work
without his help, I persuaded a student, who lodges near my quarters,
to piece the scraps of paper together. It took him two hours to do so,
and we then pasted them carefully on this sheet of foolscap. You will
see, Saheb, that there are thirty-seven in all, and only three
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story made a deep impression on Mr. Henderson and the Police
Inspector, while Pulin was raised to the seventh heaven of delight by
the thought that his innocence might yet be established,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you identify the boy?&rdquo; asked the Europeans with
one breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; was
R&aacute;mtonu&rsquo;s rejoinder; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2310" href="#xd26e2310" name=
"xd26e2310">171</a>]</span>&ldquo;but I think I could pick him out, for
he passes this office daily on his way to and from school. But this is
just the time when he goes home for tiffin. With your Highness&rsquo;s
permission, I will watch for him in the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so by all means,&rdquo; was the Inspector&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll take down notes of your
statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>R&aacute;mtonu went out and in a few minutes returned dragging with
him triumphantly a well-dressed lad of fifteen, who seemed terribly
alarmed by the company into which he was thrust. The Inspector calmed
his fears by assuring him that he would come to no harm if only he
spoke the whole truth. &ldquo;You have been unwittingly made the
instrument of a forgery,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and we want your help
towards detecting it.&rdquo; The boy plucked up courage and answered
every question put him quite candidly. His tale corroborated
R&aacute;mtonu&rsquo;s in most particulars, with the addition that the
tall babu had given him eight annas <i>bakshish</i> for cashing the
cheque. He had not seen either of the men previously, but thought he
should be able to recognise one of them owing to his unusual
height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, bearer,&rdquo; said Mr. Henderson, &ldquo;go and fetch
both the clerks; bring in the tall one first, but keep an eye on the
other outside and beyond earshot.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2321" href="#xd26e2321" name="xd26e2321">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>R&aacute;mtonu left the room with alacrity and presently returned
ushering Lakshminarain into the dreaded presence. The newcomer was
beside himself with terror; and when he was identified by the schoolboy
as one of the men who had employed him to cash the cheque, he did not
wait to be asked for an explanation. Throwing himself at Mr.
Henderson&rsquo;s feet he begged for mercy, promising to reveal the
entire truth. The Inspector would make no promises but simply adjured
him to make a clean breast of his share in the transaction.
Lakshminarain obeyed, and his statement, interrupted by many sobs, was
duly recorded. His accomplice was next introduced. At first
Gy&aacute;nendra was inclined to put a bold face on the matter, stoutly
affirming that it was a put-up affair between Pulin and R&aacute;mtonu.
When, however, the Inspector read out to him the deposition of the
bearer and schoolboy, he saw that the game was up and confessed his
misdoings, accusing the head clerk of having prompted them. The
culprits were taken in a <i>ticc&aacute; g&aacute;ri</i> (four-wheeled
cab) to the police station Pulin occupying the box, while
R&aacute;mtonu ran behind.</p>
<p>Well, to cut a long story short, the prisoners stuck to their
confession and refunded their ill-gotten gains. They were duly
committed to the High Court on charges of forgery and conspiring to
accuse an innocent man of the like offence. They both pleaded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2330" href="#xd26e2330" name=
"xd26e2330">173</a>]</span> guilty, and the judge remarked that it was
one of the worst cases of the kind he had ever tried. In passing
sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment on each prisoner, he added
that they would have fared worse but for the patent fact that they had
been made catspaws of by some one who kept in the background. As there
was no evidence against Debnath Babu, except that of accomplices, he
was not prosecuted; but immediately after the trial, Messrs. Kerr &amp;
Dunlop dismissed him without notice. Kisari Babu was promoted to the
vacant office of head clerk, while Pulin stepped into his
friend&rsquo;s shoes. By unfailing application to duty, he won Messrs.
Kerr &amp; Dunlop&rsquo;s entire confidence, and in fulness of time
succeeded Kisari Babu as head clerk. Ten or twelve years later, Pulin
was rich enough to build a <i>pakka</i> (masonry) house at Kadampur,
which far eclipsed his father-in-law&rsquo;s, and had a well-paid
doorkeeper in the person of R&aacute;mtonu. The once-despised
<i>gharjam&aacute;i</i> took a leading position among the local gentry.

<h2 class="main">Gobardhan&rsquo;s Triumph.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Jadu Babu&rsquo;s four-year-old daughter, Mrinalini,
or Mrinu as she was called in the family, came to her mother one
evening to say that her kitten was lost. In vain was she taken on the
maternal lap, her tears gently wiped away, and all manner of pretty
toys promised. Her little frame was convulsed with sobs, and she
refused to be comforted. So her mother sent a maidservant to search for
the plaything. The girl returned shortly and said that the kitten was
certainly not in the house. At this Mrinu howled more loudly than ever,
bringing her father on the scene. He pacified the child by undertaking
to produce her pet, and told the servants that the finder would be
handsomely rewarded. Meanwhile his wife was trying to keep
Mrinu&rsquo;s attention engaged by telling her a long story, when she
suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;What has become of your <i>jasam</i> (gold
bracelet)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrinu replied, &ldquo;I took it off to play with kitty and laid it
down somewhere&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This was all the information she could vouchsafe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2351" href="#xd26e2351" name=
"xd26e2351">175</a>]</span>in answer to repeated questions. The mother
set her down and proceeded to search every hole and corner for the
<i>jasam</i>, but it was not to be found. Her husband was greatly
alarmed on hearing of this untoward event. The loss of Rs. 100, at
which the trinket was valued, might have been borne; but Hindus believe
that misfortune invariably follows the loss of gold. He set all his
servants and hangers-on to look for the <i>jasam</i>, but they were
unsuccessful. In despair he hurried to Nalini for advice and was told
to send for Gobardhan, which he promptly did.</p>
<p>The astrologer listened attentively to his story and then asked
whether Jadu Babu would try <i>B&aacute;ti Ch&aacute;l&aacute;</i>
(divination by the <i>b&aacute;ta</i> leaf), or some simpler method of
discovering the lost <i>jasam</i>. On learning that the matter would be
left entirely in his hands, he told Jadu Babu to collect all his
servants in the parlour and let him have half a seer (1 lb.) of raw
rice, with as many strips of banana leaf as there were servants. When
all were assembled, Gobardhan thus addressed them, &ldquo;Mrinu has
lost her <i>jasam</i>, have any of you seen it?&rdquo; The reply was a
chorus of &ldquo;Noes&rdquo; with emphatic head-shakings. &ldquo;Then
none of you have stolen it?&rdquo; Again a volume of protestations.
&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Gobardhan, &ldquo;I must try the
ordeal of chewed rice.&rdquo; After uttering many <i>mantras</i>
(incantations) and waving his hand over the pile of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2377" href="#xd26e2377" name=
"xd26e2377">176</a>]</span>grain and banana leaves, he dealt out a
quotum of each to the servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will masticate the rice for a
minute thoroughly and then drop the result on your leaves. I warn you
that it will be deadly poison for the thief.&rdquo; All obeyed with
alacrity, and Gobardhan, after examining the contents of each leaf,
assured Jadu Babu that the <i>jasam</i> had not been stolen.</p>
<p>My readers who are versed in science will understand that, in point
of fact, there is nothing magical about this rite, which is based on
the circumstance that fear checks the flow of saliva. In all
probability a thief would eject the rice absolutely dry.</p>
<p>The inference was that <i>the jasam</i> had been mislaid; and Jadu
Babu asked whether Gobardhan&rsquo;s lore was equal to recovering
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; answered the astrologer, &ldquo;but it is
not a case of B&aacute;ti Ch&aacute;l&aacute;; if you can guarantee me
Rs. 10, I will perform <i>N&aacute;kha Darpan</i> (literally
&lsquo;nail-mirror&rsquo;). Let me have an almanac, please, to find an
auspicious day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After examining it and receiving a ten-rupee note from Jadu Babu,
the astrologer said oracularly that he would return on the following
afternoon, with a lad of twelve, who had been born under the
Constellation of the Scales.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, Gobardhan came accompanied <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2400" href="#xd26e2400" name=
"xd26e2400">177</a>]</span>by his acolyte, with whom he sat down at the
Chandimandab (a shrine of the goddess Durga, found in most Hindu
houses, which serves for social gatherings). Jadu Babu and the
<i>bhadra-lok</i> (gentle-folk) took their seats there too, while the
underlings formed a respectful half-circle in front. Adjuring all to
keep perfect silence, he asked the lad to gaze into the nail on his own
right index finger and tell the people what he saw there. After staring
at it for a minute or so, the boy began to tremble violently and
whispered: &ldquo;I see a mango-tope (orchard); a little girl is
playing with her kitten under the trees. Now I see her slipping a
<i>jasam</i> from her arm, the kitten frisks about, and the child
follows it; now it disappears, and the child runs indoors.&rdquo; Then,
raising his voice to a shrill scream, he pointed with his left hand to
the north and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those animals which are prowling in the orchard? Are
they dogs? No&mdash;they are jackals&mdash;one, two, three jackals!
They pounce on the kitten, and tear her limb from limb! Now everything
is growing hazy; I can&rsquo;t see any more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thrill of fear ran through the audience, and one might have heard
a pin drop. At length Gobardhan broke the silence:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the mango-tope north of this house,&rdquo; he
said solemnly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2415" href=
"#xd26e2415" name="xd26e2415">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thither they hurried and, after a few minutes&rsquo; search, one of
the maidservants cried out that she had found the <i>jasam</i>
half-hidden by the gnarled roots of a tree.</p>
<p>Jadu Babu was overjoyed by the recovery of his missing jewel, and
pressed another fee of ten rupees on the astrologer. As for Gobardhan,
his fame spread far and wide, and his hut was rarely without some
client, eager to learn the future. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">Patience is a Virtue.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">S&aacute;dhu Sheikh of Simulgachi was not long in
finding a husband for his half-sister, Maini Bibi. Before she was
fourteen, a young farmer named Ramz&aacute;n proposed for her hand,
offering a <i>den mohur</i> of Rs. 100. The <i>den mohur</i> is a
device recognised by Mohammadan law for protecting married women from
capricious repudiation. The husband binds himself to refund a
fictitious dowry, generally far above his means, in case he should
divorce his wife for no fault of hers. Ramz&aacute;n was accepted by
S&aacute;dhu, and the marriage was duly celebrated. Maini Bibi was a
handsome girl; but beauty was among the least of her gifts. She was
sweet-tempered, thrifty, and obedient, winning sympathy on all sides.
The one discordant note was struck by Ramz&aacute;n&rsquo;s mother,
Fatima Bibi by name, who took a violent dislike to the bride and
evinced it by persistently scolding and ill-using her. Ramz&aacute;n
was completely under his mother&rsquo;s thumb and saw everything with
her eyes. His love for Maini was slowly sapped by her innuendoes,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2435" href="#xd26e2435" name=
"xd26e2435">180</a>]</span>and he treated the poor girl with something
worse than coldness. Maini, however, bore her hard lot without a
murmur, hoping that time and patience would win back her
husband&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>On returning one evening from the fields, Ramz&aacute;n was hailed
by his mother who was evidently in a worse temper than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Ramz&aacute;n,&rdquo; she shrieked, &ldquo;I am an old
woman, and you, doubtless, find me an incumbrance. Speak out, my son;
you have only to say &lsquo;go,&rsquo; and I will leave this house in
half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, mother?&rdquo; asked
Ramz&aacute;n with open eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter,&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;Would you believe it, that
black-faced daughter of a pig has actually abused me&mdash;me, your old
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; rejoined Ramz&aacute;n angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;you know how she
neglects household duties, leaving all the hard jobs to me. Well, this
afternoon, I ventured on a word of remonstrance, and she actually
abused me.&rdquo; And the old woman wiped her tears away with a corner
of her cotton wrapper, adding with eyes cast heavenwards,
&ldquo;Merciful Allah, to think that I should come to this in my old
age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did she say?&rdquo; repeated Ramz&aacute;n wearily.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2451" href="#xd26e2451" name=
"xd26e2451">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me to my face that I had forgotten to put salt into
the curry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly abusive,&rdquo; rejoined
Ramz&aacute;n.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so,&rdquo; shouted Fatima. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re
taking sides with her against your mother, who bore you. You will
assuredly suffer in Jehannam (hell) for such a crime! But I&rsquo;ll
have it out with that she-devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she dashed from the room to the kitchen, where the
luckless Maini was cowering in anticipation of a coming storm. She was
not deceived. Fatima seized her by the hair and administered a sound
thumping.</p>
<p>Several days passed by, bringing no alleviation to her fate. But
matters came to a crisis on a certain morning, owing to
Ramz&aacute;n&rsquo;s complaint that his wife had over-salted the
curry. On tasting the food, Fatima burst into violent imprecations and
&ldquo;went for&rdquo; her daughter-in-law, who took refuge in the
neighbouring brushwood. At nightfall she crept back to the house and
found Ramz&aacute;n closeted with his mother. They were talking
earnestly, but Maini could not distinguish the purport of the
conversation. It seemed to her that Fatima&rsquo;s voice was raised in
entreaty, and Ramz&aacute;n was objecting to some scheme proposed by
her. She passed the night sleepless and in tears.</p>
<p>Early next day Ramz&aacute;n entered her room and said <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2465" href="#xd26e2465" name=
"xd26e2465">182</a>]</span>gruffly, &ldquo;Get up, collect your
chattels, and follow me. I am going to take you back to
S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Maini obeyed without a word of
remonstrance, and a quarter of an hour later the ill-assorted pair
might have been seen walking towards Simulgachi.</p>
<p>The rainy season was now in full swing, and their path lay across a
deep nullah (ravine) through which mighty volumes of drainage water
were finding their way to the Ganges. On reaching a bamboo foot-bridge
which spanned it, Ramz&aacute;n ordered his wife to go first. Ere she
reached the opposite bank, he gave her a violent shove, which sent her
shrieking vainly for help into the swirling torrent below.</p>
<p>Hardly had Ramz&aacute;n perpetrated this odious deed than he felt
he would give his chances of <i>bihisht</i> (paradise) to recall it. He
ran along the bank shouting frantically, &ldquo;Maini! Maini!&rdquo;
Alas! her slender body was carried like a straw by the foaming water
towards the Ganges and soon disappeared in a bend of the nullah. Then
her murderer sat down and gave himself up to despair. But the sun was
up; people were stirring in the fields; and so he slunk homewards.
Fatima stood on the threshold and raised her eyebrows inquiringly; but
Ramz&aacute;n thrust her aside, muttering, &ldquo;It is done,&rdquo;
and shut himself up in his wife&rsquo;s room. There everything reminded
him of her; the scrupulous neatness of floor and
walls&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2474" href="#xd26e2474"
name="xd26e2474">183</a>]</span>no cobwebs hanging from the rafters,
the kitchen utensils shining like mirrors. He sat down and burst into a
flood of tears.</p>
<p>For several days he did not exchange a word with his accomplice, and
dared not go to market lest his worst fears should be realised. Dread
of personal consequences added new torture to unavailing remorse. Every
moment he expected the red-pagried ministers of justice to appear and
hale him to the scaffold. The position was clearly past bearing. So,
too, thought Fatima, for she waylaid her son one afternoon and said:
&ldquo;Ramz&aacute;n, I cannot stand this life any longer; let me go to
my brother Mahmud Sardar, the cooly-catcher&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he replied sullenly, and the old woman gathered up
her belongings in a bundle and departed, leaving him to face the dark
future alone.</p>
<p>While brooding over his fate, he was startled by the sudden arrival
of S&aacute;dhu. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m in for it,&rdquo; he thought and
began to tremble violently while his features assumed an ashen hue. But
Sadhu sat down by his side and said, &ldquo;Ramz&aacute;n, I&rsquo;ve
come about Maini&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s drowned!&rdquo; gasped Ramz&aacute;n.
&ldquo;By Allah the Highest, I swear that I did my best to save
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; rejoined S&aacute;dhu with great surprise;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2486" href="#xd26e2486" name=
"xd26e2486">184</a>]</span>&ldquo;you must have been with her when she
fell into the nullah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramz&aacute;n bent his head in silence. After a few moments he
looked up, clasped his hands, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth, S&aacute;dhu, is Maini alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;On Thursday morning she
came to our house dripping wet and quite exhausted, with a story that
your mother had turned her out of doors and that she was on her way to
live with us when, on crossing the Padmajali Nullah, her foot slipped
and she fell into the water. She told us how, after being carried for
nearly a gau-coss (lit. cow league, the distance at which a cow&rsquo;s
lowing can be heard), she was swept by the stream against the
overhanging roots of a pipal tree <i>(ficus religiosa)</i> and managed
to clamber up the bank. But Maini never told us that you were with her.
Why, Ramz&aacute;n, you&rsquo;re quaking in every limb. I always
suspected Maini had concealed the truth. Swear on the Quran that you
did not try to drown her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramz&aacute;n feebly protested innocence, and the two men sat awhile
without speaking.</p>
<p>At length S&aacute;dhu said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to make you a
proposal. Young Es&aacute;f, the son of Ibrahim of our village, has
fallen in love with Maini and wants to marry her. He is willing to pay
the <i>den mohur</i> of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2505" href=
"#xd26e2505" name="xd26e2505">185</a>]</span>Rs. 100 which would be due
from you in case of repudiation. Now we want you to divorce
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramz&aacute;n was overcome by his wife&rsquo;s magnanimity, and the
thought of losing her drove him to distraction. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he
shouted, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t divorce her. I&rsquo;ll fetch her back
this very day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite out of the question,&rdquo; rejoined
S&aacute;dhu. &ldquo;Maini cannot bear her mother-in-law&rsquo;s
cruelty, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll never consent to live with you
again. Besides, Es&aacute;f is a rich man and will make her happy. She
shall marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say she shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ramz&aacute;n
emphatically.</p>
<p>S&aacute;dhu got up and moved off, remarking, &ldquo;Very well, I
will go to the police station at once and charge you with attempting to
kill her! We shall soon worm the truth out of Maini, and get plenty of
eye-witnesses too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramz&aacute;n was beside himself with terror. He followed
S&aacute;dhu, clasped his feet, and groaned, &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t
do that! I am ready to divorce Maini. Let Allah&rsquo;s will be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied S&aacute;dhu, &ldquo;so you can listen to
reason after all. Come to our house to-morrow evening; we will have
witnesses ready, and Es&aacute;f will be there with the <i>den
mohur</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramz&aacute;n had a sleepless night and was too downcast to work on
the morrow. When evening came, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2525"
href="#xd26e2525" name="xd26e2525">186</a>]</span>he walked wearily to
Simulgachi. There was quite a small crowd in S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s
courtyard. On one side sat Maini and some other women with faces
closely covered; Es&aacute;f and the witnesses were on the other.
Between them was a mat, on which lay a bag full of money. Ramz&aacute;n
was received without salutations, and squatted down by
S&aacute;dhu&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Moslem husbands can get rid of their wives by repeating the word
<i>talaq</i> (surrender) thrice, in the presence of witnesses. Every
one expected him to utter the formula, which would release Maini from
his power. However, he sat silent, with downcast eyes. After a minute
or two, he rose and, looking steadily at Maini, was just about to
speak, when she sprang forward, laid her hand on his arm, and said:
&ldquo;Surely you are not going to divorce me, your faithful wife, who
loves you dearly and seeks only to make you happy? What have I done to
be treated thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur was heard in the assembly, but S&aacute;dhu raised his hand
in token of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you wish to
return to a mother-in-law who hates and persecutes you? Will
Ramz&aacute;n be able to protect you?&rdquo; Then lowering his voice,
he added, &ldquo;Is your life safe with those people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life and death,&rdquo; rejoined Maini, &ldquo;are in
Allah&rsquo;s hands. It is his will that we should fulfil our
destinies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2538" href="#xd26e2538"
name="xd26e2538">187</a>]</span>and mine is to cling to my husband. I
would not change him for H&aacute;tim T&aacute;i (a legendary hero,
very rich and generous) himself!&rdquo; Then nestling closer to
Ramz&aacute;n, she pleaded in a voice of music, &ldquo;Surely you
don&rsquo;t want to get rid of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was quite overcome and burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he sobbed, &ldquo;I will never separate from my
treasure. Come back to me, and you need not fear my mother&rsquo;s
tongue. She has left my house for good, and I swear by Allah, in the
presence of all these people, that she shall not live with us again.
You, Maini, shall be sole mistress of my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maini was overjoyed by this decision. She clapped her hands twice,
and then, picking up the bag of money, said to the crestfallen
Es&aacute;f, &ldquo;Take back your rupees; I am going home with my
husband&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So speaking, she took Ramz&aacute;n&rsquo;s hand and led him out of
the house, while a great silence fell on the crowd, broken at length by
many exclamations and a buzz of loud talk. My readers who know
Maini&rsquo;s sweet nature will not be surprised to learn that her
happiness was thenceforward without a single cloud.</p>
